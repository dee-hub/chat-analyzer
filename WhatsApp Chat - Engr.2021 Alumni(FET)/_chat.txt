[5/5/22, 2:40:09 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: That second point means nothing
[5/5/22, 2:40:31 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: They could have as well typed out just the first point
[5/5/22, 2:41:17 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: They kuku did not say only female students, they just put it there to show that female applicants are welcome
[5/5/22, 2:41:33 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Toxic how 😂
[5/5/22, 2:47:11 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: Why the second point at all¿
[5/5/22, 2:47:51 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: It shows that if both are qualified equally, the female still have edge because na female

[5/5/22, 2:52:20 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: If anybody says it, ignore them
[5/5/22, 2:52:57 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Na because people dey give gender matters audience, is why they exist in the first place

But the fine print is not showing any form of “toxic feminism”
[5/5/22, 2:55:29 PM] Habeebulah: Which one is not showing toxic feminism
[5/5/22, 2:56:15 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: As an applicant, you wouldn’t even know that your seat was given to another person because she’s female

If applicants are too much 
They’ll be prioritizing attending to females more (and first) 

Right ?
[5/5/22, 3:43:50 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Thanks
[5/5/22, 3:48:55 PM] DV Glory: Probably something like a slot for 10 males, 10 females.
Something like that...
[5/5/22, 3:49:51 PM] Quadri: Maybe
[5/5/22, 4:57:16 PM] Ridwan: Probably
 but if it's not required it won't be there so you only stand a chance when there's no female amongst the applicants

 Rejoinder Over A Write-up By Tunde Salihu Castigating ASUU Due To Strike

-Abdullahi Junaidu

 I accidentally met a write up circulating media castigating ASUU over the incessant strike asking them to manage the situation of no fund in the country and forfeit their demands as nothing is going properly in Nigeria, my rejoinder will be against only that point for now !

Let me call his attention, in Nigeria it is only poor masses are asked to manage the situation under the pretext of no fund but the top elites in govt position are always earmarking huge amount of money for their frivilous and greedy sentiment, he didn't ask senators or any member of National assembly to forfeit their allowances and sacrifice some percentage of their salary for managing the life of Nigerians.

Between these greedy & incompetent leaders and poor masses who deserve to forfeit their entitlement to manage the life of one another ? Everyday we are seeing looting everywhere and still govt is screaming of no fund, no fund for education but there is fund to loot. Govt top officials are enjoying their luxury lives with 100% amenities while that of masses are hijacked telling them to manage the situation of no fund. 
We are seeing them distributing luxury cars and buying aspiration forms of millions.

Every year there is  Budget of renovating every office in villa and National assembly, even thier furnitures and decorations, allowances for servicing their vehicles and weekly newspaper which are all frivolous & greedy expenditure considering the country situation, huge amount of money are earmarked for these, if these money could be diverted to Education sector it would be a great achievement. 
Education and these frivolous office renovation which one supposed to forfeit it's own share ?
We have to think rational please.

Yes ! Strike is not the only option to solve this issue, students should also storm Abuja and block every road in a bid to pressure the govt to act urgently, this will surely yield better fruits as it is the only language Nigerian govt understands !

We still have some blockhead writers that have absurd audacity to support govt in trying to destroy education system by advising them to eliminate ASUU...
Be rest assured, if ASUU is dissolved today, education system will not last for decade, even if it does, poor people can no longer afford it as it will be very expensive and that is what Govt want. So we have to wake up and do the necessary !

[5/13/22, 7:36:51 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Lmao
Be enlightened

In the eyes of sharia law
The only thing they’re guilty of is they didn’t let her face the judge 
She would have been stoned to death either ways
[5/13/22, 7:36:58 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Are Jihad and Terrorist the same thing or you wanted to say “those aren’t Jihad”?

She’d die surely

But the Nigerian constitution provides for non believers by allowing them to choose not to be tried in front of a sharia court
[5/13/22, 7:45:38 AM] Teslim Cyborg: But they don’t rate the Nigerian constitution in that part of the country

Especially if it has to do with religion

Al-An'am 6:68

وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا۟ فِى حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِۦۚ وَإِمَّا يُنسِيَنَّكَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَلَا تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ 

And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse concerning Our verses, then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation. And if Satan should cause you to forget, then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.

There were several cases of blasphemy during the days of the prophet, did he ask the sahabas to kill them? Did he encourage killing them?
[5/13/22, 7:55:49 AM] ‪+234 810 015 8195‬: What they did was very wrong wallohi, even if we' are in an Islamic country, the judgement is not to be carried out by them but the Muslim leader. But in a country like ours, the best thing they can do is just to warn and admonish her since we are not in an Islamic country, or at least report her to d govt. They did what they did out of ignorance and it's a criminal act. They even went to the extent of burning her, in which it's forbidden for anybody to purnish someone with fire except Allah. They just did what they did in their own interest not in defense of Islam. Islam is free from their ignorance.

[5/13/22, 7:58:03 AM] Teslim Cyborg: This is where I said be enlightened 

I said sharia law 
Not the Quran 

Sharia law is just like any other law

Shariah is mainly from 4 sources

Quran 
Hadith 
Consensus of ulama
Analogically deduction 


In that order


So it’s not only the provision of the Quran is follows 
It has their things attached to it 
Read up
I’m not educating you on that anymore than I have 
I’m just stating facts
Sharia law states that anybody that is guilty blasphemy is to be killed
Anybody that steals should have a hand cut off except he steals because of hunger ( this isn’t in the Quran too, but it’s a law)
[5/13/22, 7:59:01 AM] Latee Yekini: Unless u go school of shari'ah
[5/13/22, 7:59:03 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Wo

We’re just doing our pet and what we believe to be right

But yh
Let me also reply


A lot of things that wasn’t in the Quran and Hadith are in sharia laws 
Like I said the law is sourced from many places 
The prophet never killed anyone or asked anyone to kill based on blasphemy 
But the law that governs Muslims
The sharia law
It provides for blasphemous people to be killed 

So how we go do ?

I gave an example of the hand cutting stuff
Even the flogging of people that have sex before marriage
It isn’t in the Quran 
But it’s in the law
[5/13/22, 8:04:02 AM] Teslim Cyborg: So you no be kabiru 

I thought it was Kabiru in material science

[5/13/22, 8:06:14 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Wait 
Let me get your point 

According to Sharia law blasphemous people shouldn’t be killed ?
Is that what you’re saying ?
I’m not asking you according to the Quran o 
According to Sharia law 
Are you saying it states that blasphemous people shouldn’t be killed ?

[5/13/22, 8:13:10 AM] Teslim Cyborg: It’s not from your point of view
Some scholars used their own notion to create rules
Especially this blasphemy 
God didn’t stay it 
Prophet didn’t say it 
It was human like you and I that decided on that and you’re telling me I’m a non believer for condemning it ?
Who be that guy ?
[5/13/22, 8:13:20 AM] Quadri: But sharia law condemns it and it’s punishable by death

[5/13/22, 8:30:51 AM] Asiyanbolatayo: To punish a Muslim by blasphemy, 
1  he must be sane
2. He must  have understand the importance of the prophet in islam( that he is not to be abuse)
3. He must be adamant that he is not interested in asking for forgiveness

These savages 
The only thing they’re guilty of is taking law in their hands
If she was reported
It’s the same forken thing that would have been done

Insane people

[5/13/22, 8:34:49 AM] Latee Yekini: What they did was wrong na simple
[5/13/22, 8:34:51 AM] Quadri: No 
According to what he said there 
He’s saying sharia doesn’t accept death as punishment for blasphemy 
And that’s a lie
[5/13/22, 8:35:07 AM] Latee Yekini: We don ask Una to bring scans
[5/13/22, 8:35:14 AM] Latee Yekini: E get reason why
[5/13/22, 8:36:28 AM] Teslim Cyborg: It isn’t savage 
It seems like that cause of recent times
Let me explain


The prophet then married an underage girl
Because no dy had any minimal age for marriage then so they used menstruation as a MECH mark to determine readiness for marriage
Can’t blame him
It was the Norm then

Anybody that uses it now is an animal cause now we’ve established the age system and we have human rights 


Same thing with these laws
It was the Norm then
That time
It was 
But we have universal declaration of human right now 
We can’t be acting as they did then
Let us have the same laws but use it in rElation to the reality of today
That’s my own

Not following it blindly

Ok good 

But are our northern brothers enlightened ???
[5/13/22, 8:38:07 AM] ‪+234 701 806 9372‬: To be honest, death is the penalty for blasphemy. But it doesn’t mean we still have to follow those rules
[5/13/22, 8:38:25 AM] Latee Yekini: So we have all been saying the same thing
[5/13/22, 8:38:49 AM] Latee Yekini: Why the arguement
[5/13/22, 8:38:36 AM] Quadri: First off 
It’s a death punishment for Muslims 
I haven’t seen anywhere that said for non believers 
But these people no sabi anything
[5/13/22, 8:39:03 AM] Quadri: But do they know that ? 
And why is someone cutting corners and saying death isn’t the penalty ???
[5/13/22, 8:39:04 AM] Latee Yekini: No misyarn 
Death is penalty for blasphemy for a Muslim*
[5/13/22, 8:39:06 AM] Teslim Cyborg: They made it savage
Sharia itself isn’t 
Allah is supreme and he has taught us to be loving

And I’d follow his words like a sheep
Cause he preaches love

Any other thing na wahala for who dy follow am
[5/13/22, 8:39:07 AM] Asiyanbolatayo: Islamic laws has it prescribed laws for any err on the side of it adherent, accepting Islam means accepting this laws.

For the punishment of blasphemy, I know it is death for any Muslim, but I don't know where the law can be found( I will research more this).

For fornication, it is flogging both party, while adultery is punishable by death under ISLAMIC laws.


These laws can only be proclaimed by rla reputable imam and not just mobs
[5/13/22, 8:39:24 AM] ‪+234 701 806 9372‬: Nah
[5/13/22, 8:39:46 AM] ‪+234 810 015 8195‬: It's Haram for anybody to kill any soul unjustly Islam. But there are instances that an Islamic govt can kill an individual that commits a grave crime that it's punishment is killing.  Like killing a murderer, a married person that committed adultery, or apostasy or even blasphemy. The judgement for all these is death. But all these can not be carried out by an individual except those in authority in an Islamic country. If an individual do such, then judgement will passed upon him as well.

It's really surprising how fast most industries in Nigeria are generalizing toward tech too.

There are well over 2 mobile mechanics apps now. You simply download their app and they will reach out to you anywhere in case of a breakdown. What's the catch? They offer monthly and quarterly payment options 😀, omoooo. 

To think that I discussed this with someone in mechanical engineering a while ago when such haven't even become well-known.

Imagine he wore jalamia 
They’d say he’s a Muslim and it’s what Islam preaches
[5/15/22, 10:23:27 AM] Teslim Cyborg: God will vindicate us 
That are ireaching the true meaning of Islam

They’re Muslims afterall
It’s always their religion

[5/15/22, 10:26:07 AM] Durosinlorun Akeem: The fact that he wasn't killed at the spot is what is irritating me, kill him and let he's creator judge him and the people he killed. Remember the teenager that killed people at the night of protest the other time, remember he's a freeman now...
[5/15/22, 10:26:07 AM] Quadri: Tbh

[5/15/22, 10:30:24 AM] ‪+234 810 413 0059‬: I understand your view tho .. since blacks were killed at an instant
[5/15/22, 10:30:44 AM] Quadri: Still doesn’t mean you should serve justice on your own 

Is that what Islam preaches ??
And you’re a Muslim brother
[5/15/22, 10:30:58 AM] Durosinlorun Akeem: Judge for what again? Did he not commit the crime?
[5/15/22, 10:32:19 AM] Durosinlorun Akeem: Don't get me wrong brother. All I'm saying is he might still live 60 years more since he's not a black, you get?

[5/15/22, 1:20:59 PM] Teslim Cyborg: An average northerner that’s an extremist can not read the Quran 
A proven fact
And a vast majority are drug dealers
They consume highest number of tramadol in the sub Saharan region
Nothern Nigeria 


A lot of things are involved in this thing 
They only listen to their imams 
Those are the fanatics 
They weaponize poverty and illiteracy so as to ensure those youths do their bidding
Imam with PhD from university of London is fighting against girl child education 
His own daughter is in Essex university 


So these people 
They’re far from being Muslims
A lot of people aren’t just willing to listen

Imagine Jonah coming back after 3 days of absence; No phone call, no message, nothing, only to tell his wife he was swallowed by a fish and vomited after 3 days 😀😃😃 
just imagine how that sounded.

The wife will feel like breaking his head.⛏⛏
"Swallowed by fish, really?* 
Are you talking to a baby?* 
What an insult! lying to me as if I don't have any brains? 
Which fish? mackerel or tilapia"?,😀

Even if Jonah reported the issue to a pastor, the pastor will call him aside and say brother Jonah, why not pray against lying spirits?😊

Neighbors will shout "ahh madam, you don't understand, the fish is another woman".😀
But between you and I,
Jonah was telling the truth.

[5/17/22, 8:56:31 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: In ancient culture, they build this bull shaped structure with metal, all those metals that doesn't melt rather easily. 

Lock him in and set fire underneath the structure, his skin would melt slowly the heat won't kill him because there would be enough ventilation for the carbon monoxide to escape. History has it that it often takes most criminals over 48hours to die.

Sound sweet until you start sweating profusely, flies enter and start eating the sweet stuff until they get to the person and start eating their flesh. 

The person also defecates inside the canoe so na real vat of disease and infection 

This happens over a period of weeks 💀

Elon musk's father owned an emerald mine in apartheid South Africa-MONEY
Jeff Bezos started Amazon with 300,000 dollars that he got from his parents and from his rich friends-MONEY
Bill Gate's mum sat on the same board as the CEO of IBM and convinced him to take a risk on her son's new company- CONNECTION.
Mark Zuckerbeg was attending one of the best universities in the world, Harvard. He dropped out to focus on Facebook and he was given the opportunity to showcase what he had- WORKING SYSTEM.
Warren Buffett is the son of a powerful m congressman who owned an investment company-FAMILY BACKGROUND.
The fact is, it's harder for a person who has no connection, no money, no family support, or a working system to make it than a person who has one or even all of these.
Even Dangote isn't from a poor home. His grandfather, Dantata was once one of the richest men in Nigeria- FOUNDATION.
My point exactly is, the only thing you have is education, why exactly are you motivating yourself with "most of the world richest men are school dropouts"?
Firstly, only 0.7 percent of world richest people are dropouts but have you even considered what the system is like and what they drop out for?
Mark Zuckerbeg dropped out because he had built Facebook, he had been given a platform to showcase it and he needed to concentrate.
He didn't drop out because of carryovers or bad behaviours, or no school fees, etc.
They dropped out to focus. They were one of the brightest in their various classes. You are using basket to pack numerous carryovers every semester in uniben, and you want to motivate yourself with the story of brilliant people who dropped out of Harvard, really?
See, the only thing you have is education. Why not try as much as you can to make the best of it?
Education is very important, it's no scam. You don't just get education from schooling. You connects with people, make friends and you are even more opened to opportunities while in school. Why are you like this?
Focus, my dear.
You have no connection,
You have no money,
You have no family support,
You have no working system,
But, the only thing you have is education and you are taking it for granted?
Really?
Think about it...

4: Marry a woman who has sense enough to know that ensuring that the family is well fed *good food*, a woman with sense will make effort to get that sorted out through other means and take responsibility of that aspect of the family 👪 life.

7: Marry a woman who has sense enough to know that though she has the right to always voice out her frustrations, a right to agree 👍 and disagree, a right to air his opinions, the manner in which she does so much not make her husband feel disrespected as the head of the home.

The formula of husband and wife shouldering financial responsibility 50/50
[5/22/22, 2:15:23 PM] DV Glory: It will.
Because you believe in the roles, now if she decides to step in, you'd feel less of yourself.

For example, you can only afford covenant for your children, but she can afford MIT, and decides to pay their fees.
What do you think will happen...

[5/24/22, 6:25:42 PM] ‪+234 906 542 5811‬: Marry now with the little you have. Don't wait to be a millionaire, Have kids early so you can grow with them. Grow with your kids and succeed with your wife. 
You will never finish making money or achieving your plans. You might still not succeed at your target year. So start your life early, with consistency you will grow.

My father said this to me: When I was 25, I was talking about making billions before I marry.
Many years later, billions didn't come, yet no kid no wife... I had an opportunity to marry the most beautiful love of my life very early, But my fear was, can I really take care of her? 
But right now She's married with Four grown up children. The guy that married her was still schooling then, but had the courage. They worked hard and succeeded together. 
So please if you can feed yourself, you can feed your wife. You have to believe it, marry early, don't wait.

Stay away from abortion.
Don't make our mistakes, I see
my childhood friends play with their kids.. 
Most of them are not doing as well as me.. But they are happier with their families..

Trust me it isn't money only, but Rather your Maturity, your happiness depends entirely on your wisdom and the way you Handle Life, with a well planned life they are happier.

Trust me it isn't money, What is our problem? Build mansion? buy the latest Car in Town? marry Sharon stone type? but still we don't have those things we dreamt of, and of course the years we wasted, we can never have them neverrrr!!!_

Please don't be 60yrs old and your kids will still be in their 20's..What are you supposed to be at that age? Their grand father.
Please young men, take my advice seriously.

Marry, don't be afraid, that girl you are finding too many fault in has many good qualities if you look well.

Don't think you will get every thing before you settle down.

With a good determination and focus with your wife by your side, we will succeed by God grace....Amen!

DEDICATED TO ALL SINGLE PEOPLE TNX AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

I hope I have made some Sense here

[5/29/22, 7:23:00 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Dear All,

Please note that tension is brewing in various parts of the Nation. From the violence in sokoto, to the gas explosion in Kano and the okada riders clashes in the FCT, we need to be very careful of our immediate surroundings.

Utmost Caution is advocated for everyone. Please take note of the following:

1.Please go out with your ID card but hide it from public view.
2. Remove any insignia that shows where you work. Even Banks souvenirs should be taken out e.g air freshers with Banks logo etc 

3. Maintain silence in heated arguments  and don't make any use of extreme words in discussions..e.g Nonsense , rubbish, madness etc out of your narratives.

4. Keep your phones and delete any transactions with sms. Email is available for reference .

5. Alter your paths to your home or workplace. Routine is a weakness that can be exploited. Change your route and Timings consistently.  

6. Go low profile...No excessive show of wealth or affluence. 

7. NEVER ARGUE WITH these Okada riders and pls AVOID any altercation .Be careful  , they are looking for trouble.

8.There is so much hunger and pain in the country and tempers are hot.Hungry men are Angry men.

9. Make less social media appearances. There are softwares for sifting information from your postings for analysis and intelligence gathering.

10.Pray well before leaving home..and inform your family members of your movements.

[5/30/22, 2:06:33 PM] Kyrex AERO: Yeah pretty much
[5/30/22, 2:06:57 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Is there socializing in a mosque ?
[5/30/22, 2:09:30 PM] Kyrex AERO: Intoresting question. 
It's more ideal to pray in congregation than alone so that's part of why it's there. So there is in some way or form socializing there. You get to interact with people, but it's not always going to happen.
[5/30/22, 2:10:30 PM] Quadri: Yep
[5/30/22, 2:11:31 PM] Kyrex AERO: Well a lot of things have lost their true essence due to being tainted by cultural and societal ish
[5/30/22, 2:12:00 PM] DV Glory: What actually makes socialising possible in church is fellowships and units...
[5/30/22, 2:12:32 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: And people staying back to gist
[5/30/22, 2:14:28 PM] DV Glory: Yeah.
Waiting because of Meetings involved with one or more members of the family... 🥲
[5/30/22, 2:19:05 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Not as much as in a church 
In addition 
A lot of extremist now 

Best to keep socialization in a mosque at extremely minimal level
[5/30/22, 5:52:50 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: *WHY RHESUS FACTOR CAUSES MISCARRIAGES*

*If you are Rh positive eg(A+,B+,O+,AB+)you are safe but if you are negative eg(A-,B-,O-,AB-)you are not.*

*If you are a male Rh negative ,you are safe;if you are a female you are not safe.*

If you are a Rh negative  woman and get pregnant for a man who is Rh negative ,you are safe but if you get pregnant for a man who is Rh positive ,you are not safe.

Most people are Rh positive, only very few are negative. The possibility for a Rh negative woman to find a Rh negative man is slim,that's where the problem lies.
[5/30/22, 5:52:51 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: Let us assume a lady is Rh negative and during her school days she aborted a pregnancy,the man who got her pregnant then was Rh positive,obviously her baby was Rh positive. 

During abortion,the Rh positive blood came in contact with her Rh negative blood. 

That was the beginning of her problems.
[5/30/22, 5:52:51 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: Once Rh negative comes in contact with Rh positive,a certain antibodies are activated. 

This antibodies are activated to stop they think is a threat from coming   into the body. Eg.a baby. 

A Rh positive woman with an activated antibodies would keep fighting and taking off any foetus.
[5/30/22, 5:52:52 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: *Women with activated antibodies are Rh sensitized and once this antibodies are activated,it can never be deactivated until the woman dies*

Antibodies are activated in a Rh negative woman by
➡️abortion 
➡️ectopic pregnancy 
➡️miscarriage 
➡️child birth
[5/30/22, 5:52:52 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: The woman might end up childless and if not properly informed might think she is under a demonic oppression.

[5/30/22, 5:52:53 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: During childbirth of a Rh negative woman who got pregnant by a Rh positive man,children inherit their rhesus factor from the man so once the baby's Rh positive comes in contact with the woman Rh negative during delivery,the antibiotics are immediately activated so after that particular child birth,the woman would keep having miscarriages because the activated antibodies would as usual fight off any foreign body.
[5/30/22, 5:52:54 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: The antibodies can be stopped from being activated by administering an injection known as 'Rh immunoglobulin' to a negative woman.

The injection is administered 28weeks into pregnancy,72 hours after delivery,after ectopic pregnancy,miscarriage or abortion. 

If it is not administered and the antibodies are activated,it would never be deactivated.
[5/30/22, 5:52:54 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: *Because our dysfunctional health system doesn't promote proper rhesus factor sensitization, a lady is left helpless after one mistake.*

*Mothers tell your girls and sisters, a Rh negative girl must be extremely careful.*

*This because of the very small number of Rh negative people.*

*It is extremely rare to find a Rh negative man.*

*The possibility to get pregnant for a Rh positive man is high.*

*Once she gets pregnant for a positive man and rushes to have a quick abortion,she might have as well jeopardized her future for life.*
[5/30/22, 5:52:54 PM] ‪+234 907 514 9452‬: *Also Note:*👇

*A Rh negative man or woman cannot receive blood  donation from a Rh positive.*

*It would lead to death as the blood would immediately clog and cake.*

And no interest in a better economy.
His only interest presently is to become President.
[6/4/22, 12:01:01 PM] Latee Yekini: He was disqualified?
[6/4/22, 12:01:49 PM] Quadri: So I heard
[6/4/22, 12:02:09 PM] Latee Yekini: Merde
[6/4/22, 12:02:22 PM] Latee Yekini: This man dey on very limited time
[6/4/22, 12:02:44 PM] Latee Yekini: Iono why he was allowed to enter in the first place
[6/4/22, 12:04:31 PM] Quadri: Interesting
[6/4/22, 12:04:59 PM] Quadri: So let’s assume he wasn’t disqualified 
His chances in the north are slim is your point
[6/4/22, 12:05:17 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: You are not allowed into politics.
Hope you know sha.

So my father is discussing with some other men 
Igbo guys sha and I’m picking on or two 

Apparently the north are coming together irrespective of party to sideline tinubu
[6/4/22, 12:06:26 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Nope, not by a long shot 

The two of them are hungry
[6/4/22, 12:06:43 PM] DV Glory: 🌚
[6/4/22, 12:07:40 PM] Quadri: Probably that’s why he’s been disqualified 
Being betrayed by Buhari

So atiku can take power 

Tambuwal stepped down for atiku After a secret meeting with buhari 
(And tambuwal is in PDP🙂)
[6/4/22, 12:08:28 PM] Quadri: Exactly 
Atiku after so many tries
[6/4/22, 12:08:50 PM] Quadri: Where dee and teslim na
[6/4/22, 12:09:48 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Party first
[6/4/22, 12:10:20 PM] Quadri: I believe the northerners believe in brotherhood first than party 

Maybe 
Idk
[6/4/22, 12:10:33 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: No way Buhari would allow Atiku take power
[6/4/22, 12:10:34 PM] DV Glory: Exactly, Especially with Atiku.
[6/4/22, 12:10:45 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: They believe in the long game
[6/4/22, 12:11:04 PM] DV Glory: 🥲
What is their reason?
[6/4/22, 12:11:04 PM] Quadri: I get you
[6/4/22, 12:11:24 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Omo, I can’t stand another northern president mehn
[6/4/22, 12:11:20 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Whatever will ensure power returns back to the North
[6/4/22, 12:11:31 PM] Quadri: Lmao 
They want power back to the north nooni
[6/4/22, 12:11:35 PM] Quadri: That’s what I think sha
[6/4/22, 12:11:47 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Power is already in the North na
[6/4/22, 12:12:03 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: They don’t have balls to tackle our security problems because on some level, they are related to the perps
[6/4/22, 12:11:57 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Tinubu from start is a no go
[6/4/22, 12:11:58 PM] Quadri: I mean 
Continuing in the north
[6/4/22, 12:11:59 PM] DV Glory: Feasible reason sha.
[6/4/22, 12:12:07 PM] DV Glory: 😅
[6/4/22, 12:12:11 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If he wasn't disqualified now, he would have been sidelined eventually
[6/4/22, 12:12:15 PM] Quadri: Some reason…
[6/4/22, 12:12:31 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Atiku deleted his tweet soliciting with Deborah when she was maimed
[6/4/22, 12:12:24 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: No way in hell APC would use Tinubu as their flag bearer
[6/4/22, 12:12:25 PM] Quadri: Abi

[6/4/22, 12:12:39 PM] Quadri: Saw that 

People forgot already sha
[6/4/22, 12:12:48 PM] Quadri: Why ?

[6/4/22, 12:18:20 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If Tinubu emerges, Atiku will effortlessly win the election
[6/4/22, 12:18:28 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Unless Tinubu has a northerner as vice sha

Anambra is a state 
Nigeria as a country is a much more different ball game 

Even anambra
He was frustrated to the point that he was impeached 

Talk more of the entire country that the northerners are in strategic position already

If Jesus comes down and Obi wins
Best believe he will be impeached 
He would step on toes 
And those pieces of shit will bring him down

If he doesn’t want to step on toes 
He wouldn’t do anything 

Either ways 
It’s bad for him


In addition
Why would a man whose tribe want to secede be given the autonomy of being our president

I don’t buy that idea

[6/4/22, 2:19:33 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Glory

A Muslim/Muslim ticket will fly in Nigeria 
They can win 

Only ish is senate has to go to Christians 

It would cause headache especially if atiku picks someone from the east 

But a Muslim/Muslim ticket will work
[6/4/22, 2:20:59 PM] DV Glory: Actually, a Christian campaign can then be started.
I don't think it has ever happened before; where CAN actively campaigns
[6/4/22, 2:22:59 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Let me explain using this tinubu matter 

Let’s assume he chooses a both Muslim as vice 
Christians aren’t predominant in the north
So those ines don’t really care
Where we have such religious sentiment is the south
I think every sane person can agree tinubu has south west in his back pocket


Leaving only the south east 
Those ones 
Their collective votes no reach Kano state and katsina state alone
So atiku can have those 
He’d place his focus on south west which he would win and north which he would share with atiku
[6/4/22, 2:23:13 PM] Teslim Cyborg: A northern Muslim as vice *
[6/4/22, 2:24:18 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I’m just now finding out that I can’t think straight about other topics after participating in a discussion about next year’s elections 😂

[6/4/22, 2:28:52 PM] DV Glory: Yes.
[6/4/22, 2:29:56 PM] DV Glory: In the past, they always try to stay politically neutral.
I don't think with what has been experienced in the few years ago, they will keep shut.
[6/4/22, 2:30:40 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Torh 

Tinubu is a politician per excellence 
Dirty one at that 

Trust me 
He’d appease the community
[6/4/22, 2:32:19 PM] DV Glory: Possible, but unlikely.
What sort of appease can he offer with a Muslim-Muslim ticket¿
[6/4/22, 2:33:44 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Appointments
Ministerial and likewise

Senate presidency
Amongst others


Moreover CAN would campaign for atiku cause his vice is a Christian ?
I also doubt that sha
If it were a Christian president 
Then yh
But he’s just vice 
Osinbajo has proved how powerless that position is/can be
[6/4/22, 2:34:17 PM] Teslim Cyborg: I wonder how atiku managed to hold the country to ransom even as a vice

That nigga is something else

[6/4/22, 2:36:52 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Yeah


Shebi Buhari handedly over to osinbajo too at a time

Atiku na Cunt per excellence
[6/4/22, 2:37:01 PM] Habeebulah: Strong*
[6/4/22, 2:37:26 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Homeboy wanted to get presidential ticket as a vice
Even when his principal has shown interest for second term 😂😂😂😂

Atiku is a different kind of fucker
[6/4/22, 2:37:44 PM] Habeebulah: I feel the era Tinubu gained control of Lagos wasn't as competitive as this time so he might not be able to do it
[6/4/22, 2:37:56 PM] Habeebulah: Confirm mf😂😂
[6/4/22, 2:38:44 PM] DV Glory: Ọmọ.
Definitely has to be assymetric, as in, way above normal offers.

And, they might then campaign Obi. 🥲
[6/4/22, 2:40:17 PM] DV Glory: And Nigeria is different from Lagos.

If Tinubu handled states like Ekiti and Kwara, I bet he wouldn't be successful.
[6/4/22, 2:41:48 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Obasanjo that attested to the amount of generational wealth Atiku swiped
[6/4/22, 2:42:03 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: A seat that neuters it’s occupier
[6/4/22, 2:45:42 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Obi can never be our president


Please don’t let Twitter deceive you

CAN can obviously campaign for him 
That’d be a way of staying neutral cause every human knows Obi can not win


Man doesn’t even share money
His party is a poor party 
They don’t have one governorship or senate seat

All odds are against him
[6/4/22, 2:46:19 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Yes it can be way above normal
The best way to appease them for the Muslim/Muslim vibe


But best believe
Muslim/Muslim will fly in this country

They’d leave it for each other 
All of them will rally round to support  their own


Na wetin fuck wike and Obi up for PDP
If two of them had come together and agreed for one of them to run

My fellow colleagues, this ones talk say dem wan do industrial robotic arm for ₦400k.

One NEMA 23 motor, which is not even ideal for an industrial robot costs approximately $35+.
At least 6 are needed, hence $210.
[6/4/22, 11:24:37 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: An elderly yoruba friend was always excited about southern unity and how igbos are ready this time to leave Nigeria.  I told him then that it won't happen.  The igbos make a lot of noise on the social media but are the most I'll prepared to exit Nigeria.  My reason was that from the first republic, igbos have domination in mind. Zik opted to work with Sardauna because he believed that since the north is less exposed educationally, they can be dominated. In 1979, ekweme was VP to fulani shagari.  Zik again entered into an agreement with NPN which produced Ume Ezeoke as speaker and Joseph Wayas as Senate president.  Akinloye and co were made to battle Awo while Umaru Dikko became an extraordinary minister. In 1999, 2 yorubas were the main gladiators.  In 2007, yar'adua, a fulani, won in the southeast. The Jonathan government was run by igbos. Check out the main players. From Anyim to okonjo iweala etc. When Jonathan lost the 2015 election, the igbos were the most pained. Far more than the people of the south south where Jonathan came from.  Their  opposition to the Buhari government has nothing to do with performance.  Its because no igbo man is in aso rock.  Otherwise, to them Buhari will do no wrong.  95 southeast delegates went to Abuja for PDP presidential primary.  80 voted for Atiku, a fulani. 14 voted for Anyim.  1 for Wike. These are the same people who will want us to believe that they are against fulani domination.  Today, they are falling over themselves to be Atikus vice.  Uzo Kalu is today the DG of Ahmed Lawan campaign organisation.  Yeye dey smell!

[6/8/22, 2:24:49 PM] DV Glory: Apparently, Gowon is the best and the worst in terms of economy growth. Mostly because of war.
[6/8/22, 2:24:57 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: People are collecting PVC bro
[6/8/22, 2:25:02 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: It's not just social media
[6/8/22, 2:25:08 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: But it definitely starts from there
[6/8/22, 2:25:23 PM] DV Glory: He was 32 years old. 🥲
[6/8/22, 2:25:26 PM] Quadri: Who ?
[6/8/22, 2:25:27 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If social media is not powerful why would they shut down twitter for the better part of a year
[6/8/22, 2:25:32 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: PO
[6/8/22, 2:25:39 PM] Quadri: I get hope niyen o

[6/8/22, 2:26:56 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: They will both embark on a full scale revenge mission first of all
[6/8/22, 2:27:11 PM] DV Glory: Realistically. BAT is the winner. Miraculously, PO can win.
[6/8/22, 2:27:13 PM] Quadri: @2348101171936

[6/8/22, 2:27:55 PM] DV Glory: I am wondering who will be VP...
[6/8/22, 2:28:02 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Realistically, 15 million people voted in Buhari, 10 million new voters just registered, over 80% of them are youths
[6/8/22, 2:28:13 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I am surprised at these mindsets honestly

[6/8/22, 2:29:16 PM] Teslim Cyborg: I think everyone is entitled to Cervantes whoever it is they want to without being guilt tripped

Tinubu was not in power for endsars 
All these accusations re just vibes
He doesn’t control the police or the army 
He has reiterated he doesn’t own oriental 
Amongst others

If the guy is a tinubu fan 
Let him celebrate 
Don’t tell him he doesn’t have sense

The only people that it would be wrong to celebrate are those in power rn 
Tinubu isn’t among


I’m not a Tinubu fan but I just feel whoever that is should be allowed to joyous
Don’t insult them
[6/8/22, 2:29:22 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Celebrate *
[6/8/22, 2:29:40 PM] DV Glory: As a matter of fact, there are over 50 million registered voters that don't vote. If PO can activate that... Unlikely though...
[6/8/22, 2:30:34 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Realistically people slept overnight at lekki toll gate, though everyone said that's impossible, youths can't endure kinikan
[6/8/22, 2:30:42 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Will we come out ?
Will we  stand under sun for hours ?
Amongst we youths are people that would vote atiku and tinubu 

Atiku and tinubu will still rig
[6/8/22, 2:31:14 PM] Latee Yekini: Yes na
[6/8/22, 2:31:20 PM] Latee Yekini: Do u need stat for that?
[6/8/22, 2:31:33 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Realistically, they told youths, they will kill them and they still stood their ground.
[6/8/22, 2:31:59 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes we will. So long I cast your vote for PO, I can tell my kids I did all I could to make Nigeria great again

May we succeed in our quest to make Nigeria great again
[6/8/22, 2:32:41 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Realistically nobody wan die before, but na because police never butt you with gun, na why
[6/8/22, 2:32:43 PM] DV Glory: People. Just a fraction oo. But anyways, that is why I call it a miracle.
[6/8/22, 2:33:05 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: That fraction disbanded SARS and reduced police brutality

[6/8/22, 2:35:29 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: No but dem dey canvass on twitter
[6/8/22, 2:35:44 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If every youth can convince their parents to vote for PO, then he will win 💯

Whether your intentions are pure or not 

Your investments will get you returns 

We should all take a cue from that

Tinubu has put all his people in strategic places
Now people are surprised that he has won this 

Are we sure peter Obi without a party structure 
A man from a tribe that wants to secede 
A man that is not popular asides on twitter
A man that knows no one in power
A man that doesn’t want to spend 
Can beat the likes of Tinubu and atiku in Nigeria?

Let’s wait and see

Make I no talk
[6/8/22, 2:57:53 PM] Teslim Cyborg: He’s not a good leader is what I’m telling 

But he’s what we have 


He over atiku 
Infact @2348142837502 over atiku 
Sub-dean over Atiku
[6/8/22, 2:57:59 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: So which devil will you prefer 

Obi devil or Atiku’s devil 😒
[6/8/22, 2:58:01 PM] DV Glory: Others could easily also be experts. Bukola also is an expert.
What I'm trying to explain is that he had good favour on his side.
[6/8/22, 2:58:23 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: You and I know ATIKU is there for one purpose
[6/8/22, 2:58:26 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Good Favour 


Well said
[6/8/22, 2:58:42 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I no know why my phone dey always capitalize ATIKU

[6/8/22, 2:59:31 PM] DV Glory: Literally, Northern delegates where at his back.
I'm wondering if it's because they like Tinubu or because they believe it is Tinubu that can defeat Atiku.
[6/8/22, 2:59:33 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Should I be honest ?
Tinubu is there for the same reason
Same as Buhari 

They just want to be written in history books 
They don’t want to be forgotten 
Not like they have anything to offer us 

Atiku’s own is sprinkled with a dash of money hunger
[6/8/22, 3:00:12 PM] DV Glory: He paid Apple. 😂
[6/8/22, 3:00:31 PM] Quadri: You probably have a name saved as that
[6/8/22, 3:00:31 PM] DV Glory: @2348104804265 jere
[6/8/22, 3:00:39 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: And you and I know that purpose won’t be of any good to everybody at least with jagaban we’ve a chance to suffer in peace 
But with atiku it’s a bye bye to peace and prosperity 😂
[6/8/22, 3:00:44 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Delegates are under their governor 
Tinubu made their governor 

Hence 


I mean look at the way northern governors were telling chairman that they don’t want power that it should be zoned to the south
Tinubu na oga o
[6/8/22, 3:00:49 PM] DV Glory: I go tag wrong message
[6/8/22, 3:02:06 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: An educated madman looking for power

[6/8/22, 3:02:41 PM] DV Glory: Yeah sha.
[6/8/22, 3:02:42 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Fulani herdsmen will be the order of the day if atiku steps in to power 

At least I know tinubu will not be under any northern control 
And southerners don’t care about religion
We are humans 
So best believe he’d curb herdsmen menace
Buhari has given them a free hand for a long time
Atiku would give them a freer hand 
Forgive my English
‎[6/8/22, 3:02:43 PM] BoogieMan😈😈:  ‎sticker omitted
[6/8/22, 3:04:21 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Exactly my point 

The reason most of us are still comfortable with jagaban is because of peace 

With Atiku in power forget about peace y’all just going to put yourself in a squid  game of life for 4years
[6/8/22, 3:04:27 PM] DV Glory: Like this.
We no even dey focus Senate President.
Who go be SP báyìí...

[6/8/22, 3:04:36 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Most of us on this group weren’t old enough when atiku was VP

I want too but I read a lot and y dad enlightened me 
Atiku held the country at its neck 
Obasanjo couldn’t control his vice
I can’t imagine that kind of man now being in full control
[6/8/22, 3:04:37 PM] DV Glory: 😂
[6/8/22, 3:04:56 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: And trust me that won’t favor all of us 😂

We thought Buhari would do it 
As per former general 

Na when them never enter we dey speculate 
I hope he doesn’t disappoint us too.
[6/8/22, 3:07:17 PM] DV Glory: 🥲
Tinubu can actually be good for Nigeria. At least an action man finally, since OBJ.
[6/8/22, 3:07:25 PM] Teslim Cyborg: I want make Obi win
At least we would have able hands 

But should he win
National assemble will frustrate him
Northerners in general will frustrate him
Cabals will frustrate him
His own igbo brothers
Will frustrate him 
He will not be able to do shii 
He doesn’t belong to the majority 


Only if Jesus comes down to vote for him
[6/8/22, 3:07:36 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Even if he was or he’s  healthy Nii 
You sha understand my point 

All he needs to do is give the order he’s the Number 1 citizen that’s why he has boys to do a lot for him
[6/8/22, 3:07:45 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Buhari sef supoose be action man
Until he left my country on auto pilot
[6/8/22, 3:07:46 PM] DV Glory: Yeah sha...

[6/8/22, 3:09:02 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Fact on Facts 

He has too many problems affecting him aside from the fact that he wants to win
[6/8/22, 3:09:22 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: And that’s not good product for we the consumers 😂😂
[6/8/22, 3:09:56 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Now, na to see where interests align 

Buhari likes his steak grass fed, well roamed and medium rare. Na why he no fit clamp down on these murderous bastards. 

Atiku na X2

Tinubu has the interest of “Yoruba nation at heart” but I’m still skeptical of if he’ll be effective.
[6/8/22, 3:10:03 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Buhari Na ripper 😂😂

[6/8/22, 3:30:48 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Vote 


Like a ballot 
They’d pick if they want to leave or not

Just like brexit
[6/8/22, 3:31:31 PM] Quadri: Ohhh
[6/8/22, 3:31:54 PM] Teslim Cyborg: That’s what they should have been clamoring for 

Not all these agidi they’re doing with sit at home and all that 

They’re just making things worse for themselves
[6/8/22, 3:32:19 PM] DV Glory: What is the process?
[6/8/22, 3:34:33 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Fantastic 😂😂😂, problem is that will lead to another civil war over resources
[6/8/22, 3:35:04 PM] Teslim Cyborg: It would be difficult for them sha 
European Union is a confederation 
Secession is allowed 
That’s why Britain did an internal referendum for their citizens to decide whether or not they should leave the EU

But we are a federation not a confederation 
So a referendum is not feasible
It’s a criminal offence to even clmaour for it 

However 
If the vast majority clamours for it and the sitting government finds validity in their cry and they can’t address their complaints 
They would give them a referendum 

So it depends on the sitting government 
They might choose not to grant them that
[6/8/22, 3:38:24 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: And if you’re been honest do you think that’s possible????
[6/8/22, 3:39:09 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Definitely not

They have the oil
No government will ever grant them that 

Ever
[6/8/22, 3:40:45 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: That settles the argument then
[6/8/22, 3:41:35 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Not quite, no country splits without a war sha
[6/8/22, 3:42:01 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Moreover 
The moment they leave

Everywhere go scatter
[6/8/22, 3:42:20 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: That's the last resort and they are prepping for that
[6/8/22, 3:42:31 PM] Teslim Cyborg: They would be killed again
It’s better they don’t clamor for war 

Na so ojukwu deceive them
[6/8/22, 3:42:40 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Are they ???
[6/8/22, 3:43:04 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Have you seen army retaliation on some towns there
[6/8/22, 3:43:48 PM] Teslim Cyborg: That nonsense sit at home that they’re doing sef

If no be say Buhari leave country for autopilot 

He suppose don  do them bad
[6/8/22, 3:43:51 PM] DV Glory: UN nko?
[6/8/22, 3:44:16 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Same thing
You can leave the UN if you like na
[6/8/22, 3:44:24 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Morocco left AU
[6/8/22, 3:44:41 PM] Teslim Cyborg: You can always leave all those confederations
[6/8/22, 3:44:55 PM] DV Glory: I mean external influence to allow them seperate.
[6/8/22, 3:45:57 PM] Teslim Cyborg: We are a sovereign nation


Nobody
Not even the UN can tension us to allow a part of us leave 
They aren’t allow to meddle in our internal affairs
[6/8/22, 3:46:31 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Exactly 
See Wetin sup for orlu in owerri

Those Nigga just destroyed a voting center see how many innocent people that died when the army retaliated
[6/8/22, 3:46:40 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Omo don’t even try war
[6/8/22, 3:46:53 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Allowed*
[6/8/22, 3:46:54 PM] DV Glory: 🥲
[6/8/22, 3:47:08 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: IPOB or ESN don’t have the ammunition the Nigerian army has 

Not even close
[6/8/22, 3:47:22 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Dem go see shege
[6/8/22, 3:48:08 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Ojukwu deceived them

“If igboho was around, they won’t kill people in ondo”

I say if igboho was around 
Amotekun would have been another ESN
[6/8/22, 3:49:10 PM] Yemi: And the funniest about this seceding of a thing...

They were the one that rejected the right for secession when the AG brought it to table back in the days.
[6/8/22, 3:49:45 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Most of them shouting for separation don’t have strong business in Lagos 

Most of them with strong business in Lagos or educated ones don’t want to separate Na only the illiterate and jobless ones wan separate
[6/8/22, 3:50:07 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Na even north wan secede that time 😂😂😂

Igbo people are actually not good people

[6/8/22, 3:51:12 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Exactly

[6/13/22, 6:02:11 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Ahh, it’s Monday I can continue my crusade.

All this one no really mean anything tbh 

LP isn’t as a strong a party as the other two juggernauts but people have been volunteering to put that structure it so desperately needs in place, even from the North! 

If he didn’t think LP supporters had the number, he wouldn’t bother making this thread. Did he bother making a thread on the other sound but way less popular people vying for the presidential seat? There’s video evidence of people coming out en masse because LP gave them a reason to. They are donating, volunteering, “witnessing” LOL. 

He might not win, yes. But people that need a overhaul in our governance would still press LP on their ballots. 

If not for systematic manipulative tactics, that narrative of the north determines the winner is another cap.
[6/13/22, 6:06:20 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I’m biased here but Omo, I can’t help it (and a million others). Insulting people that support Tinubu is not far fetched man. 

His actions(or inactions as portrayed) led to the killing of people that were protesting against a decaying police force. 

A very large number of us here fit the description of people that Nigeria’s police like to harass and that’s what those people were protesting against. Almost everyone here has had an encounter with the police and that’s what people were shot for at the tollgate. So I really don’t get where you peoples anger left too (even the ones that protested). Do you want the police to continue harassing you because their annual salary can’t purchase the clothes or phone you’re using ?
[6/13/22, 6:10:28 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I will press LP on my ballot, but if PO doesn’t win, then obviously I’d prefer Tinubu to win than that other man
[6/13/22, 6:18:51 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: This structure that you want to vote for @2349065425811 is the same one that has somehow impeded peoples hustle in one way or the other. It used to be that we could just use our card to buy crypto but now you can get someone’s account frozen by just sending a large sum and adding “crypto” to the narration. It is under this same “structure”, that banks have the audacity to limit peoples international spending to $20/month. This same structure made the price of food unbearable for a good number of people so they can easily win their hearts with small food come next election. You seem like you use twitter a lot, your favorite structure banned that based on a vegetables feelings being hurt (can’t forget the crap Lai Mohammed was saying about VPNs)

You now want to vote for this same structure that’s going to have a potentially senile man as it’s flag bearer so that the structure and its minions would go crazy?

Hell No to Atiku; he will first recover his resources all dz failed yrs den still not handle d northern corruption

PO is a crazy man but will do d job although dey might plan impeachment later but he has always won dat so make we try him
[6/15/22, 2:01:36 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I don't even understand why Tinubu wants to become the president

They’ll do their best to sabotage his movement. 
He’s gaining the trust of the people. But trust me it’s not one of us who’s trust he has that’ll help there in the senate and co. 
Impeachment is a long journey. 

They could probably just work against his mission 
It’s that simple.
[6/15/22, 2:03:47 PM] Quadri: Like you don’t know these people.

[6/15/22, 2:04:55 PM] Quadri: I hope he is 
But you understand what I’m getting at 

I really really hope they let him work 
Cause these people would just want to frustrate his tenure
[6/15/22, 2:05:06 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: He must have predicted all those already and going by his current gameplay, I believe he has that in the works too

*GROUP  MEMBERS* 

For those who are posting free internet data, free this and free that.

Let  me  teach  you some basic  ICT. Any  Link  that  start with  *"http* " is  most likely a phishing link. 

Phishing  is  usually intended  to  get  your Personal  details including  your  date  of Birth,  Bank  Account Number  etc. 

*BE  ALERT*

This  is  how  Scammers and  Hackers  steal  your identity and  use  them to  Scam. 

*PLEASE  BE  CAREFUL AND TAKE  NOTE*

👉Avoid random links. 
👉Avoid all these null Data links, 
👉MTN, Airtel, etc  are  not  sharing  data. 
👉The  Government  is not sharing  Money via WhatsApp
👉Your  Bank  is  not sharing Money 

 

*ACTION*

Be  Smart  and  Ignore those  links  for  your Own  Good.

Stop  forwarding  as received  without proper  Verification because you might put someone's life in danger.

There is no free Money,
There is no free Credit
There is no free Data anywhere  in  Africa  via  Links

What is the difference between *http* and *https*? Please make sure you read this to the end.

Some of you may be aware of this difference, but it is worth sharing for many that are not.

The *main* difference between *http://* and *https://* is all about keeping you *secure*. 

*HTTP* stands for *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol*. 
The *S* stands for *"Secure"*. 
If you visit a Website or web page, and look at the address in the web browser and it begins with the following: *http:///*. 

This means that the website is talking to your browser using 
the regular unsecured language. In other words, it is possible for someone to "eavesdrop" on your computer's conversation with the Website. If you fill out a form on the website, someone might see the information you send to that site. 

This is why you never ever enter your credit card number in an 
Http website! But if the web address begins with https://, that means your computer is talking to the website in a 
Secure code that no one can eavesdrop on. 

Now, you understand why this is so important, right? 

If a website ever asks you to enter your Credit/Debit card Information, you should automatically check to see if the web 
address begins with *https://*. 

If it doesn't, you should *NEVER* enter sensitive Information such as a credit/debit card number. 

While checking the name of any website, first look for the domain extension (.com or .org, .co, .in, .net etc). The name just before this is the domain name of the website. Example, *http://amazon.diwali-festivals.com*, the word before *.com* is *"diwali-festivals"* (and NOT *"amazon"*). 
So, this webpage does not belong to *amazon.com* but rather belongs to *"diwali-festivals.com"*, which we all haven't heard of before.

You can similarly check for bank frauds.
Before your ebanking logins, make sure that the name just before *".com"* is the name of your bank. *"Something.Ecobank.com"* belongs to Ecobank ; but, *Ecobank.some1else.com* belongs to "some1else".

You've hopefully learned something new, now please share and educate others.

Be secured & stay safe as more scammers and cyber criminals are on the loose these days

God bless you all. 🙏Copied

[7/26/22, 10:25:24 PM] Gold: *KWASU Dissociates Self From Its Local ASUU’s Views During NLC Solidarity Rally*

The Management of the Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete has dissociated itself from the banner displayed by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), KWASU Branch during the solidarity rally by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) held Ilorin on Tuesday, (July 26, 2022).

In a statement signed by the Registrar of the institution, Dr (Mrs) Wasilat Sallee and made available to newsmen in Ilorin, the KWASU management called on the public to disregard the views expressed in the banner, saying in a vehement term that the views do not represent the views of the Management.

“The views expressed in the banner do not represent the views of KWASU Management and should be disregarded.

“The University, since inception, has enjoyed the support and goodwill of its proprietor, the Kwara State Government. The University has many capital projects undertaken by the Government. Recently, the Government under the able leadership of Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq committed huge funds to the completion of the Osi and Ilesa Baruba campuses of the University. The University has also been assured of intervention funds once the dwindling finances of the Government improve.

“The University appreciates all these gestures of the Kwara State Government and will continue to support the efforts of the Government in positioning the University for local and international competitiveness” the statement added.

[8/10/22, 11:04:03 PM] Miami Sheriff: So sad

 😰A King had a male servant who in all circumstances always told him;  My King, do not be discouraged because *God never makes mistakes*.  One day they went hunting and a wild animal attacked the king, the servant managed to kill the animal but couldn't save his majesty from losing a finger.  Furious and without showing gratitude, the King said;  If God was good, I wouldn't have been attacked and lost a finger.  The servant answered: 'despite all these things, I can only tell you that God is good and everything he does is perfect, he is never wrong'.  Outraged by the response, the king ordered the arrest of his servant.  While he was taken to prison, he again said to the king: God is good and perfect.  Another day, the king went alone for another hunt and was captured by savages who use human beings for sacrifice.  On the altar, the savages discovered that the king did not have a finger in place, he was freed because he was not considered "complete" to be offered to the gods.  On his return to the palace, he ordered the release of his servant and said;  My friend, God was really good to me.  I was almost killed but for lack of a single finger, I was let go.  But I have a question;  If God is so good, why did he allow me to put you in prison?  His servant answered;  My king, if I hadn't been put in prison, I would have gone with you, and I would have been sacrificed, because I don't have a missing finger.  Everything God does is perfect, he is never wrong.  Often we complain about life, and the negative things that happen to us, forgetting that everything happens for a purpose.  God knows why you are reading this post today, please bless someone with it by sharing it.  God is good and perfect!!  My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude.  When you look at your life, your career, your work or your family life, what do you say?  Do you praise God?  Do you blame Satan?  A right attitude toward God moves him forward on your behalf.  Sit down and say: Today, I'm grateful to have had a peaceful sleep, I'm grateful to be alive with possibilities, I'm happy to have a roof over me, I'm grateful to have  a job, I'm grateful to have family and friends.  Above all, I am grateful to have God in my life.  Be blessed and don't be envious or shocked when others prosper because you don't know what they went through to get there (trial, trials and tribulation) so thank God for what you have.  "Little is a lot when God is in it. It's good with the grace of God. Touch someone's life with this message if God is for us, who can be against us? Stop reading if you can't share  the message. God saw you struggling with something. God says it's over. A blessing is coming your way. If you believe in God, share this message to 5 different whatsapp groups,  don't ignore, God is going to work out two (BIG) things for you. If you believe in God, stop whatever you are doing and share it. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life.

 *don't ignore*.           👉 WOLLI OMO WOLLI.

[8/11/22, 8:03:04 AM] Mama ❤🌺🌹: What’s centrifugal pump
Or can give me the meaning of all these so I can understand how vacuum pump works.

What’s piston function in a pump 
What’s liquid ring principle 
What’s positive displacement principle?
What’s eccentrically

[8/11/22, 10:00:34 AM] Mallam Shekau: Centrifugal pump works based on d principle of a centrfuge, thus d pumps blades r designed 2 scope fluid from one end of a blade d oda (from tip 2 root or root 2 tip-inlet or outlet as d case maybe)
[8/11/22, 10:01:52 AM] Mama ❤🌺🌹: Thank you😊
[8/11/22, 10:02:26 AM] Mallam Shekau: Therefore in a vacuum pump works basically d same way
[8/11/22, 10:05:33 AM] Mallam Shekau: It sucks fluid from end at high pressure with d aid of a centrfugal pump.

[8/11/22, 11:56:48 AM] Mama ❤🌺🌹: So the movement of some of the wings responsible for the suction from the closed end to the open end causes gas to be sucked in

In this case there is liquid normally around the impeller forming a ring that acts as the piston for compressing the gases into liquid

[9/5/22, 9:43:43 PM] ‪+234 907 087 7654‬: SEXUAL IMMORALITY IS RAVAGING THE WORLD AT PRESENT.

 It has been said earlier: There will come a time when mankind will love five things and forget five things.*

1. They will love the enjoyment  of this world and forget the day of judgement.

2. They will love money and forget the day of accountability of how they acquired and spend the money.

3. They will fear things that are created and  forget the creator.

4. They will love beautiful mansions and forget their grave.

5. They will love sins and forget to seek for Allaah forgiveness.

Come to think of this?.......

1. Eternal life = free
2. Masjid entrance = free
3. Allaah Guidance = free
4. Allaah love = free
5. Breath of life = free

A. Cigarette = pay
B. Prostitution = pay
C. Alcohol =pay
D. Nightclub entrance fee= pay
E. Powers to rule the world = pay

Then why are people paying for hell fire while JANNAH is free?
Think twice
Believe in ALLAAH and you shall be saved..                    
 We always think of Valentine's day 
Birth day
Father's day
Mother's day
Children's day
Our day,
Farmer's day
Teacher's day
Christmas day
Independence day
Boxing day,
This day,
That day,
Day in Day out.

Have you ever thought of DEATH DAY and Judgement Day? Is it going to be a day of celebration or condemnation for you ?

If you’re safe, what about your friends & loved ones. Show them love by telling them about the DEATH DAY and Judgement Day.

[9/17/22, 2:45:19 PM] ‪+234 902 994 6259‬: 😂😂

[9/17/22, 2:47:13 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Worldwide 
Lecturers aren’t paid much
Except you win grants 
They aren’t paid much at all
It’s not synonymous to us alone
[9/17/22, 2:47:39 PM] Latee Yekini: Na why u need side hustle
[9/17/22, 2:47:46 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Lol
Except the money-making agencies *
[9/17/22, 2:48:20 PM] DV Glory: Yeah. Exactly. 👍🏾
‎[9/17/22, 2:48:31 PM] Latee Yekini:  ‎audio omitted
[9/17/22, 2:49:28 PM] Teslim Cyborg: But Wetin be the problem exactly

I read somewhere that it’s asuu that’s doing too much
Is it true ?
[9/17/22, 2:51:07 PM] DV Glory: Omo.
The matter is complicated abeg. 😂

ASUU is asking more than what the government can give honestly...

The only solution possible is for universities to become more autonomous.
But school fees go increase mehn...
[9/17/22, 2:51:41 PM] DV Glory: The 20k fee go turn 400k...
[9/17/22, 2:52:09 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Hmmm
What common ground can they get to
[9/17/22, 2:52:47 PM] Teslim Cyborg: As compared to America and other non European countries 
Our school fees are actually very very subsidized
[9/17/22, 2:52:48 PM] Latee Yekini: Turn into kwasu basically
[9/17/22, 2:53:01 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Federal schools that is
[9/17/22, 2:53:24 PM] DV Glory: Yeah.
Extremely...
[9/17/22, 2:53:54 PM] Teslim Cyborg: But German and Austrian schools 
How do they do it with zero tuition
[9/17/22, 2:55:00 PM] DV Glory: In my opinion, they run the schools like KWASU. 
Then find a way to engineer more revenue towards education. Basically, more money goes into TETFUND.
Then our government needs to emphasize on the fact that, not everyone needs to go to a university.
[9/17/22, 2:55:30 PM] Teslim Cyborg: The government that emphasizes on that last art would never be a popular government
[9/17/22, 2:55:45 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Part*
[9/17/22, 2:56:08 PM] DV Glory: We will have to look more into their statistics to actually know how. At the moment. I have no idea...
[9/17/22, 2:57:08 PM] DV Glory: E go hard.
Because in Nigeria, we get ego problem. 😂
[9/17/22, 2:58:05 PM] DV Glory: Other countries literally have VISA opportunities for skilled Technicians...
Dem be like hot cake. 🥲
[9/17/22, 3:12:01 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Not even ego 
The reason is for you to be successful without a university degree is very very difficult in this country 
People would swear otherwise but the statistics are there 
The numbers are there 

We do not have good alternatives 
University Education is our only hope 
It’s imbibed in us already 
That’s why we are usually the most educated sub group in any country in the world
[9/17/22, 3:20:34 PM] DV Glory: Welp.
True. There are actually a ton of jobs out there done by overqualified (inappropriately qualified) people.
Changing that is an huge job. A popular example is an engineer doing the job of an Operating Technician.
Bank Cashier wey suppose just get diploma are usually Bachelor's graduates...
Etc...
[9/17/22, 3:22:37 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Exactly 
University degree holders are already doing what non university degree holders should be doing 
You’re now saying to go to university is not compulsory 
How them wan survive 

They would ask for the head of whoever says that 

Buhari said y’all should look for job and stop relying on government appointments
Y’all came for his head 
Now this ?
Them go take over aso rock
[9/17/22, 3:24:03 PM] DV Glory: Omo.
It's one hell of a mess... 🥲
[9/17/22, 3:24:18 PM] Teslim Cyborg: And mad hike in fees too

I'm here for you if it's Agriculture... 
Some one said: 'you learn by making mistakes'
But you can also learn from other people's mistake because it may save you time, money, and stress... 
Why make the mistake yourself since you can easily check someone else's mistakes to stand well... 
Why rise, and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall to rise @ last
Where'as 
You can rise by learning from those that has fallen multiple times before success and that are willing to show how they did it... 

It saves time, money, stress etc... 


If you are thinking Agriculture 🤔🤔🤔
My dm is always open... 

Don't go and make mistakes wey idon make in the business... 

Start now! And I promise 

3 years to come you will never regret it

Husband  and wife so silent in bed .

(Wife thinking)... Why is he not talking to me?
Is he thinking of another woman? 

Is he seeing someone else? 

Don't I look appealing to him anymore?

Is he trying to dump me?

Is he now finding me ugly?🤔

Does my makeup repel him these days?

He didn't speak to me since he came in,
I know his mother does not like me.

Maybe they are arranging another wife for him.
Is this how I will end up a single mother? 

God please save my marriage.
WHY IS HE UPSET?

She gathered courage and asked him, "Honey why didn't you talk to me? What did I do to deserve all this? Tears rolling down from her eyes 😭

The husband turns and looked at her with his red eyes, angry face 😞 and angrily replied... "How on Earth could Brentford beat Manchester United 4-0 when we have players like Ronaldo, Fred and De Gea

In order for us not to be caught unaware,  Kindly act now to avoid loses .. The cashlite charges has been withdrawn with immediate effect so let's act fast.

For the unbanked individuals and companies in this group without an existing bank accounts,  you can contact me Henry Onyenagubo: 07030498816 for assistance..   

This are tough times in the country , the CBN governor is introducing stringent measures on monetary & fiscal policy to assist in salvaging the country from the elevated inflationary rates we are currently experiencing.

1. If you're taking out old note to induce new notes of same value to increase their valuation, technically you'll print less of it to shoot the demand. Printing less note at the moment is not a good idea for the economy

2. You're further condemning other lesser notes.

3. That's more like accepting that E-naira project is waste of time and resources

[10/27/22, 6:29:09 PM] Winnifred 2: It's basically nil
[10/27/22, 6:29:10 PM] Winnifred 2: Because that's what they wanted to do with dollars. Hoard it, to reduce the supply and at the end of the day, Most of the top people in this country, the real dollar spenders, still have easy access to dollars at official rate meanwhile black market price is skyrocketing.
[10/27/22, 6:29:10 PM] Winnifred 2: I didn't know about this.. 150k Naira?
[10/27/22, 6:29:54 PM] DV Glory: You only need to transact $550 to break even oo...

[10/27/22, 6:45:03 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I think they are trying to cover up something, or at least that's what Nigeria so far has taught us
[10/27/22, 6:51:56 PM] DV Glory: That's really low...

[10/27/22, 7:44:50 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: What about the soldiers guiding the oil pipes and little vessels leading to theft, b4 tompolo came in to expose them. Even though they are all partners.... ain't dey paid in cash too

They mad us think the millitants are bad, no knowing that they are worst.. sick 1.4m litters to 400k litters



Bro, naija na scam..
There's always an hidden agenda behind any move
[10/27/22, 7:49:19 PM] Teslim Cyborg: For the first time in 6 years 

I agree with you
[10/27/22, 7:49:32 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: Guy, dem go stil print am back for them...

No be APC?...

Mthewwww...

I guess they are doing all this incase PETER OBI wins...

These are things he will likely do that will really affect them seriously...
So they are doing it to be on a safer side...

Won't it be stupid if peter obi comes in to reprint naira again after Buhari as?...
No more oil theft pipes to link since almost all would have probably be exposed...

Their secret is safe since tomopol is burning down vessels, their money is too
[10/27/22, 7:50:00 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: Teslim omo weyrey🤣🤣🤣🤣

[10/27/22, 7:55:59 PM] ‪+234 802 358 0926‬: Yes, he can win

Can he or will he enjoy his tenure should be the question
[10/27/22, 7:56:50 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: Same question goes for Tinubu....

They are both on 50/50 chances...
Who want to be a ~millionaire~ *president*
[10/27/22, 7:57:45 PM] ‪+234 802 358 0926‬: Tinubu is too big for anybody to order around anyhow, I can say the same for Peter obi
[10/27/22, 7:59:33 PM] Winnifred 2: I don't have PVC btw

One Inec man made a comment, he said "It's not by one million match, do you people have your PVC? Many PVC are in their office, nobody has come to collect them" 

Many people don't want to leave Nigeria, but everyday it seems that japa is the wise move.
[10/27/22, 7:59:08 PM] ‪+234 802 358 0926‬: In  a sane country, Peter obi will be the best candidate, but unfortunately Nigeria is not sane
[10/27/22, 7:59:57 PM] Winnifred 2: Exactly
[10/27/22, 8:00:23 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: When everything in nigeria is done with hidden agenda...


Why are dey burning evidence?

People that told me that my PVC is not ready until December.
And they said October previously...
[10/27/22, 8:01:45 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Lmao
Emefiele was initially appointed by a PDP led government 
It’s not about party 
The individuals involved are greedy 
Regardless of the party
[10/27/22, 8:01:56 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: Many are mad, few are roaming
[10/27/22, 8:02:58 PM] Teslim Cyborg: A PDP government where this same Peter Obi was chairman of SEC


Again 
It’s not about party or anything 
It’s about individuals
[10/27/22, 8:05:10 PM] Flyiin~Wingz: Why not fish out the top men behind them?...

How did a Vessel as big as that move into Nigeria without the navy's notice?...
But can notice a militant's boat stealing fuel...

I come to a point where i have no drop of trust in this government...

Now imagine if tinubu becomes the president (God forbid)

Tinubu is just trying to avoid damage.

And comparing Lagos State to any other state in Nigeria is BS.
1. Lagos was the capital of Nigeria.
2. Lagos has the major port in Nigeria.
[10/28/22, 9:01:21 AM] DV Glory: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/540441-calabar-port-receives-first-large-vessel-in-three-years.html

Not even close.
[10/28/22, 9:06:53 AM] ‪+234 703 961 0666‬: You can't compare Lagos to any other state, yes but remember the same man didn't get a dime from Obasanjo during his tenure
[10/28/22, 9:06:59 AM] DV Glory: One interesting thing we want Tinubu to talk about is the source of his wealth...
[10/28/22, 9:07:48 AM] ‪+234 703 961 0666‬: But he survived with the people of Lagos by generating tax revenue

[10/28/22, 9:08:35 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Baba forget, the IGR Lagos is generating is enough
[10/28/22, 9:08:47 AM] ‪+234 703 961 0666‬: Just like asking Peter obi his source of his wealth too
[10/28/22, 9:08:47 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Lagos is an economic fortress
[10/28/22, 9:09:13 AM] DV Glory: If he doesn't collect a dime in a State like Kwara, or Kogi. He'd be wrecked.

He literally inherited a state that was the capital just 8 years ago.

Both Economic capital and Government capital.
[10/28/22, 9:09:13 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: They are rightly positioned for economic stability, their location itself is of strategic importance.

It will take someone with intention of fucking it up, to fuck it up...

[10/28/22, 9:38:51 AM] Teslim Cyborg: This is my stance 
I don’t want a former governor 
Or former president 
Or former Vice 
Or former anything political 

Fresh faces please

Emphasis on the all

[10/28/22, 9:39:31 AM] ‪+234 815 611 9190‬: Igbos are hiding under the shield of we wanting a youth president to campaign for a man from their tribe 

Yoruba wanted to be in charge, shouting for one old man 

Hausa are ready for do and die affairs


Are we slaves 💔
[10/28/22, 9:39:31 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Would twitter in real life work 

A place where residents of LGA’s meet and talk about issues in their LGA

Where someone will first give an exhortation 

Then they’ll start debating on things that happened 

Even matters as simple as “A give B belle but doesn’t want to take responsibility “, “ G and H had a business deal but G tried to jilt G”
[10/28/22, 9:40:04 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Those debates should be able to reset the people that have wicked minds
[10/28/22, 9:40:11 AM] ‪+234 815 611 9190‬: Who else could it be...A man who has never be in the system at all
[10/28/22, 9:40:35 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: But person gats get CV now

The new faces are activists 

See Sowore
[10/28/22, 9:41:01 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I don’t know much about Kingsley Moghalu but I keep seeing people root for him more than Sowore
[10/28/22, 9:41:14 AM] DV Glory: Like¿

But does that even happen anywhere in the world¿
[10/28/22, 9:42:17 AM] Teslim Cyborg: This is the idea of our type of government 
This is supposed to be an advantage over the unitary system of government 
We have just bastardized it 
We have councilors that are our next door neighbors 
Who are supposed to be reporting to lg chairman then to house of assembly reps the to governor then to federal House of Representatives to debate to presidency 

It is supposed to be a grassroot government 
But look at my country
[10/28/22, 9:42:37 AM] DV Glory: Even Seyi Makinde too...


I feel it would take a Wealthy man to pull something like this off...
[10/28/22, 9:42:39 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Trump never held a political seat 

I think
[10/28/22, 9:43:03 AM] ‪+234 815 611 9190‬: He's a Nigerian human rights activist and pro-democracy campaigner
[10/28/22, 9:43:40 AM] DV Glory: Just as I said, "wealthy".
[10/28/22, 9:44:15 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Definitely 
Kingsley moghalu is wealthy in that sense 
Former cbn deputy governor I think 

I don’t know much about his political view 
But he’s an example of what I’m trying to say 
Someone with CV
That is successful business wise or career wise 
And has never held a political office 
Void of any I owe this person so I must repay at the detriment of Nigerians
[10/28/22, 9:44:31 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Kwara state governor too is a good example
[10/28/22, 9:44:32 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: We get councilors ?
[10/28/22, 9:44:47 AM] DV Glory: Yep.

[10/28/22, 9:46:03 AM] Teslim Cyborg: You must be a successful person 
You can’t be a regular man and want to become president without having political background 

Not possible 
You must have  one 
Political experience 
Or wealth
[10/28/22, 9:46:15 AM] ‪+234 815 611 9190‬: Then what about the man who hasn't held any office at all
[10/28/22, 9:46:44 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Read what we typed 
It’s what we’re talking about
[10/28/22, 9:47:21 AM] DV Glory: Exactly.
Now, the wealthy guys are not really up for taking up that position...

Just imagine Dangote going for president, or Soft guy Tony. 🤲🏾

[10/28/22, 9:48:26 AM] Teslim Cyborg: If Obi was never a Vice Presidential candidate of PDP
I might be sucking him off rn 
But mehn 
He has already mingled deep with the so called problems of this country 
How is he any different 
Tinubu is a major problem on his own 
Same with Atiku
[10/28/22, 9:48:45 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Sowore na scam bro
[10/28/22, 9:48:48 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Only problem is, they’d have to join a major party
[10/28/22, 9:49:01 AM] DV Glory: If they don't win is where the issue will be...
[10/28/22, 9:49:26 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: If he wins, his structure go come from his old friends 😅

He’s toasting us walahi

Gets into trouble a lot 
A lot of things jhare

He was SUG President 
Challenged the authority a lot since then sef 
Had a face to face with abacha at a meeting 
SUG presidents don’t get to that level
He is a comrade to the core 
But not GCFR material
[10/28/22, 10:00:41 AM] Teslim Cyborg: As a student 
He led 5000+ students to challenge a military government 
He was arrested and tortured 
As a student 



Me I was hustling for sawdust to do torrefaction

He was just a Yoruba boy 
And quite frankly a Nigerian 
Everybody wanted abiola

Not diplomatic

You pay for keke, you go to the filling station, you get the money you gave the keke man as change. A lot of our transactions are cashless anyway. How are the cash transactions being monitored, what is the metric?

[10/29/22, 1:49:06 PM] Winnifred 2: Ehn, the dollar won't finish. It will just be a matter of declaring the source of the money. 
And our currency value will continue to reduce

[10/29/22, 1:51:06 PM] DV Glory: All these countries have gone cashless since.

If they collect all the illegal cash. But at the end, print only 10% back into the economy.

[11/2/22, 2:22:32 PM] Winnifred 2: The CBN governor keeps emphasizing on the issue of counterfeit money, but no one has yet been apprehended, and if they were, I'm sure the amount of counterfeit money wouldn't match what the CBN governor claimed. The idiot refuses to acknowledge that the CBN loaned money they didn't have and printed more money than it was supposed, which is what led to all of this nonsense.
[11/2/22, 2:25:37 PM] Winnifred 2: My conclusion is if you have ujp in progress, add fuel to it. May God be with you🙏🏽

[11/2/22, 9:55:45 PM] Kyrex AERO: Well this is what I argue as to the case for not having “good citizens” being the cause for our situation. 

Let’s be honest. Those people outside aren’t good either. They just have strict laws that calm them tf down 😂😂😂
[11/2/22, 9:56:07 PM] Habeebulah: Financial and mental capability
[11/2/22, 9:56:10 PM] Quadri: 🌝

So nobody was considering the sapa people. 
Naija sweet if you have bastard money.
[11/2/22, 9:56:11 PM] Winnifred 2: Is that why we are fighting for change?
[11/2/22, 9:56:17 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I’m ignorant asf 

So apparently,  remits and IPPIS was implemented under Buhari government
[11/2/22, 9:56:17 PM] Kyrex AERO: Our tax system here is even very iffy lol
[11/2/22, 9:56:31 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: Stay trenches and stay jiggy

A lot of us dey !
[11/2/22, 9:58:12 PM] Quadri: Omo wait. 

Where’s @2347052709067   
He would be here normally.
[11/2/22, 9:58:13 PM] Habeebulah: Remita was one of the things he did when he entered, so all monies dey go federal government hand straight
[11/2/22, 9:58:38 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: The citizens aren’t on survival mode 

They’re not looking for how to benefit from every interaction 

Everyone is looking out for one another 


People can finally love unconditionally to some extent

[11/2/22, 9:59:49 PM] Kyrex AERO: While the latter parts of this are rather utopian than real.

Something always has to give sha. For me if you’re not on survival mode and you’re covered on food, shelter and health that’s a win.
[11/2/22, 10:00:00 PM] Winnifred 2: That's true o @2347052709067  no dey talk again. Boss how far?
[11/2/22, 10:00:04 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Guy 

I’ll give him credit for that sha eve though I no like am 


My PPA, individuals and companies have to pay for inspection of their installations 

The fees can range from a few thousands to millions 

Imagine there was no remita. Na so officials go dey chop money without remiting to FG
[11/2/22, 10:00:15 PM] Quadri: Oya exit back.
[11/2/22, 10:00:16 PM] Teslim Cyborg: The simple English is

We Africans in general are not built like that 
Forget government 
We just have never had that mentality 
We are always looking for more so we can have more than the next person
It’s in our subconscious already

[11/2/22, 10:01:28 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: IPPIS too 


That means heads of agencies been dey shave off margins of their workers salaries before IPPIS came into play
[11/2/22, 10:01:53 PM] Kyrex AERO: 🤝🏾
[11/2/22, 10:01:59 PM] Quadri: These inspections agencies in Lagos too remit money directly to state government.  
Embezzlement isn’t something you can easily do.

They wan buy G-Wagon
[11/2/22, 10:04:07 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Nigerians
Are naturally competitive 
And covetous to a certain level

People for here still dey find how they go take collect 2k, 10k from contractors and such 😂💀
[11/2/22, 10:04:28 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: In everything actually
[11/2/22, 10:05:18 PM] Winnifred 2: What do we have to be content about.

I'm serving in Ogun, every 2 weeks transformer spoils. The week the transformer didn't spoil, they stole our cable. Howw??

Roads are bad, health service zero even in private practice. Customer service, security, accountability of Government. So many people barely have enough and you're talking we are not content??
[11/2/22, 10:05:20 PM] BoogieMan😈😈: If you get money con calm dem stigmatize you say you no sabi spend 
Can’t everybody just be rich and calm but NO Nigeria no wan hear 😂
[11/2/22, 10:05:28 PM] Quadri: Those people that come for inspections. 
They get money from PR. 
Like tips the company owners give them for coming.  
Before remita the inspection fee would probably go directly into their pockets. 
Those officials would share it amongst themselves.
[11/2/22, 10:05:51 PM] Kyrex AERO: Pretty much
[11/2/22, 10:05:58 PM] Quadri: Ogun state shouldn’t even be a state. 
Dapo na apoda.
[11/2/22, 10:06:29 PM] Teslim Cyborg: That’s exact what I’m saying 

Certain conditions have made us like that 
It is imbibed deep in us
[11/2/22, 10:06:48 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I dey imagine 

If Remita didn’t exist, and I was chief inspector I’ll just pocket the fees from one large inspection and go buy house
[11/2/22, 10:07:12 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I guess we can say Buhari reduced the corruption in the civil service to some extent
[11/2/22, 10:07:41 PM] Winnifred 2: I agree about the covetousness. But it's a foundational problem, the covetous are the ones mostly succeding it makes it seem like the rest are foolish to do right. Now covetousness is the order of the day, not necessarily from the heart but like a culture defect
[11/2/22, 10:07:47 PM] Quadri: Another dirty way they go through is  if where they went to inspect has contravened and they’re asked to pay a penal of say 1.5m. The officials would give them a deal where they pay like 500k directly to them and then they comot face for the contravention.  💀
But it’s always risky cause the heads might request other teams go and inspect the same property.
[11/2/22, 10:08:05 PM] Quadri: Right ! 
They were doing that before remita.
[11/2/22, 10:08:13 PM] Teslim Cyborg: The moment we get to a working environment 
We still have that survival mentality 
We just want to keep on recouping and recouping cause we know where we are coming from

People that are from those “happy” countries you mentioned 
They don’t have that in them 
As long as they’re eating 
They’re fine
[11/2/22, 10:08:23 PM] Quadri: A great deal tbh. 
But there’s still corruption. 
Just reduced.
[11/2/22, 10:08:35 PM] Kyrex AERO: I think the contented part is a receptive context. Meaning based on what they’ve been provided. Their core human necessities are met more than ours. 

Hope that clears it.
[11/2/22, 10:08:41 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: The survival will take a whole generation of stability to phase out
[11/2/22, 10:08:58 PM] Winnifred 2: That's what I'm saying

After you apply, you do one project like that, they'll check it out, yada yada... You're certified
[11/3/22, 7:18:50 PM] Winnifred 2: I think you write test too sha
[11/3/22, 7:19:10 PM] DV Glory: Definitely

You only need a Masters if you didn't do first degree in Engineering.

[11/3/22, 7:24:25 PM] Winnifred 2: I might be mistaken so don't quote me but when I did my IT there. They asked the junior engineers to fill one form that they want to send names to coren to get them licenses
[11/3/22, 7:25:06 PM] Winnifred 2: Sha most abii all of them had masters. First degree and masters abroad
[11/3/22, 7:26:25 PM] DV Glory: I think it starts from after graduation. can't be earlier.
[11/3/22, 7:26:40 PM] Quadri: 🥲
Oops.
[11/3/22, 7:27:09 PM] Quadri: Oh wait. 
Your company applies for the license for you without you doing any of those tests and all ?
[11/3/22, 7:27:52 PM] Quadri: Ohhhh. 

If it’s that way. 
Finding a reputable company/consulting firm wouldn’t be a bad idea as long as it fast tracks your license.
[11/3/22, 7:27:55 PM] Winnifred 2: After graduation, but if you serve in school, It starts after you get a real job.
[11/3/22, 7:28:28 PM] Quadri: 😹

Yeah well you can’t add teaching to your presentation at COREN.

[11/3/22, 7:29:01 PM] Quadri: Osinwin eniyan.
[11/3/22, 7:29:12 PM] DV Glory: Not really.
It's just about justifying yourself.
[11/3/22, 7:29:39 PM] Habeebulah: Abeg dpr don change name ba?
[11/3/22, 7:30:26 PM] Winnifred 2: I actually asked. It has to be 4 year experience in the field of engineering
[11/3/22, 7:30:39 PM] Winnifred 2: How do you justify teaching?
[11/3/22, 7:31:14 PM] DV Glory: They'd definitely add that.
If not, how lecturers dey get am...
[11/3/22, 7:31:21 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: You helped students build capacity thus helping Nigeria increase its human capital
[11/3/22, 7:31:43 PM] DV Glory: Yes.
You could be freelancing na.
[11/3/22, 7:32:20 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Yeah

You mentioned "real job"
[11/3/22, 7:34:11 PM] Habeebulah: I was hearing nurtc or so. I am not sure
[11/3/22, 7:34:34 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Lmao, it’s a good point though 🌚
[11/3/22, 7:34:41 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: It just lacks substance now
[11/3/22, 7:34:51 PM] Winnifred 2: Glory you would talk about your freelancing *job* right?
[11/3/22, 7:35:00 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: We are severely lacking quality engineers
[11/3/22, 7:35:35 PM] Winnifred 2: It's a great point but it won't be accepted because it doesn't prove that *you* personally built capacity for *yourself*
[11/3/22, 7:35:36 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: In that case experience gboku
[11/3/22, 7:35:58 PM] DV Glory: Definitely.

That’s for whoever wants a blue tick attached to their name.
[11/4/22, 1:48:57 PM] Kyrex AERO: Discord even costs around the same or more. I know a lot of guys that gladly pay.
[11/4/22, 1:51:42 PM] Kyrex AERO: It’s even more about cutting dead weight. Everybody is realising they don’t need the amount of people they have to run their business plus a lotta them are trying to cut expenses. 

It’s a business decision at the end of the day.
[11/4/22, 1:53:33 PM] Kyrex AERO: Just blow first lol 

You will see them. Na only if your blow no choke.
[11/4/22, 1:53:47 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Heard of it
[11/4/22, 1:54:04 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: We’re paying a cheaper price

Eventually it permeates into society.
[11/4/22, 2:01:06 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Precisely what's happening with global remote tech job now
[11/4/22, 2:02:20 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: It's not exactly skepticism, it's more of liquid ideas, you create a website simply for pet adoption, you do your IPO and people invest millions into what???
[11/4/22, 2:02:54 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: That's why the #1 rule if investment is research
[11/4/22, 2:03:45 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Tech companies constantly shift, layoffs are like very normal sef. Because today you create a data science team, tomorrow you discover your product offering no longer involves data science, boom you fire them
[11/4/22, 2:09:44 PM] Kyrex AERO: I can guarantee you it’s more of skepticism. Perception precedes logic. 

If the general public is saying bad things about something, you’re more likely to believe them. And for the fact that media highlights the scams, hacks, wallet drains and very easy routes they manage to happen, people on the outside looking in have a lot of doubt when dealing with Web 3. I don’t even know anyone in the web 3 space long enough who hasn’t had their money lost to some scam or anything even despite research. It’s just inevitable.
[11/4/22, 2:11:49 PM] Kyrex AERO: Just look at the Luna situation for example. Was going smooth for years. Then everything stew lol. The founder still dey run dem never nab am.

[11/4/22, 2:29:04 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Well you are right, it's more of public craze, it always works, that's why we have so many shit coin founders cashing out

[11/4/22, 4:35:57 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Not to even mention crypto instability
[11/4/22, 4:36:26 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: The most stable coins right now are modelled after fiat, USDT for example
[11/4/22, 4:37:11 PM] Kyrex AERO: Faster in the sense of you don’t have to go through so many processes to do a lot of things. You can transfer money across the whole world better and seamlessly, there’s no limit as to how much you can send or recieve and you don’t have to pay the banks charges or anything of sorts. It’s a much better process. 

There’s a thing called smart contracts, that’s another long discussion on its own but it’s how that aspect is run. 

The lack of trust is justified. For web 3 you don’t need to put your personal info out before you can do anything, has its advantages, has its disadvantages.
[11/4/22, 4:38:32 PM] Habeebulah: This albums wey una dey drop
[11/4/22, 4:38:36 PM] Kyrex AERO: Well of course lol 
Only Bitcoin is truly decentralised. 

Everybody else came onboard to solve one problem or the other and of course they’ll want to get their share but nonetheless still maintaining the main themes of the blockchain tech.
[11/4/22, 4:38:42 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Decentralisation is chaos, all financial institutions will stand against it, that's why it can't take off
[11/4/22, 4:38:59 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I prefer typing sef, because me no ft listen to multiple long voice notes

[11/4/22, 4:39:27 PM] Habeebulah: Yeah.
[11/4/22, 4:39:39 PM] Kyrex AERO: Yep.
[11/4/22, 4:39:47 PM] Habeebulah: Web 3 don dey since 2014 I think.
[11/4/22, 4:39:55 PM] Kyrex AERO: They won’t make it work.
[11/4/22, 4:40:03 PM] Kyrex AERO: Because it will fuck up their money
[11/4/22, 4:40:09 PM] Habeebulah: Domains and shit
[11/4/22, 4:40:47 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Precisely, entire corporations are built on such exchanges
[11/4/22, 4:41:07 PM] Kyrex AERO: Yep
[11/4/22, 4:41:26 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: MasterCard, VISA, Verve, American Express, let's assume they can pivot and make crypto debit cards
[11/4/22, 4:41:44 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Banks left out of the equation will fight it tooth and nail 😂
[11/4/22, 4:41:47 PM] Kyrex AERO: Omooo scams wey go first sup 😭😭😭

[11/4/22, 4:42:25 PM] Kyrex AERO: It’s new, lotta opportunities to manipulate people.
[11/4/22, 4:43:05 PM] Habeebulah: Wallet draining and all
[11/4/22, 4:43:22 PM] Kyrex AERO: Yep. 

If not, they’ll have wanted to know his political views, and all those nonsense that they try to box people with.

[11/4/22, 4:43:57 PM] Kyrex AERO: And yes banks go def riot against am. People go lose jobs. Like millions of people.
[11/4/22, 4:44:28 PM] Kyrex AERO: I dey tell you
[11/4/22, 4:45:12 PM] DV Glory: Interesting.
[11/4/22, 4:45:40 PM] Habeebulah: Yeah. Thank God for giving man that insight
[11/4/22, 4:46:17 PM] DV Glory: Wouldn't there be companies that will host this web3 technology¿
Just as we have Coinbase...
[11/4/22, 4:46:53 PM] Kyrex AERO: The issue isn’t with them. 

It’s the nature of the technology. You can’t change that.
[11/4/22, 4:48:00 PM] Kyrex AERO: They’ll only try to induce their own policies here or there. That’s the CEXs (Centralised exchange) there’s also DEXs (Decentralised exchanges)
[11/4/22, 4:48:05 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes there will be, the web as we know it won't change
[11/4/22, 4:48:21 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Only the way it works, specifically transactions
[11/4/22, 4:48:44 PM] Kyrex AERO: It’s only gas fees that’ll be incurred (required to process your transaction and also very minuscule except on Ethereum)
[11/4/22, 4:49:12 PM] DV Glory: Hmmmn.
How does decentralised exchange work? If they are able to make exchange easy...
[11/4/22, 4:49:35 PM] Kyrex AERO: Their own is to provide the service. Not police it.
[11/4/22, 4:49:42 PM] DV Glory: Gas fee == Bank Transaction fee Na.
[11/4/22, 4:49:54 PM] Kyrex AERO: Gimme a sec.
[11/4/22, 4:50:01 PM] DV Glory: But they can police it if they want to. 🌝

‎[11/4/22, 4:51:19 PM] Kyrex AERO:  ‎image omitted
[11/4/22, 4:51:32 PM] Kyrex AERO: Network fee is the same as gas fee
[11/4/22, 4:52:32 PM] Kyrex AERO: And gas fee goes to network validators, not the people that provide the service.
[11/4/22, 4:53:20 PM] Kyrex AERO: Very easy lol
[11/4/22, 4:53:28 PM] Kyrex AERO: Just open a wallet and send
[11/4/22, 4:53:35 PM] Kyrex AERO: Takes less than 5 minutes.
[11/4/22, 4:53:44 PM] Habeebulah: Different layers under eth network don dey make things easier sef
[11/4/22, 4:53:53 PM] Kyrex AERO: Exactly
[11/4/22, 4:54:52 PM] Kyrex AERO: Like I said again @2348101171936 

They can’t change the working principals to suit them. That’s the difference here. 

Your bank can decide to increase charges, these ones can’t. Your bank can charge your for maintenance lol, these ones can’t.
[11/4/22, 4:55:04 PM] Kyrex AERO: No matter who they are.
[11/4/22, 4:55:37 PM] Kyrex AERO: Opening a wallet is easier than a bank account.
[11/4/22, 4:55:48 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: The problem is, the network determines what to charge
[11/4/22, 4:56:09 PM] Kyrex AERO: And except you’re on ETH. It’s miniscule ser
[11/4/22, 4:56:10 PM] DV Glory: How do people that provide the service then profit¿
[11/4/22, 4:56:17 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: For banks, the fee is the same throughout even if 1 million people are on the same network
[11/4/22, 4:56:29 PM] Kyrex AERO: From other means.
[11/4/22, 4:56:34 PM] DV Glory: This is the thing.
It's easy to you. 🥲
[11/4/22, 4:56:38 PM] Kyrex AERO: Like trading and all.
[11/4/22, 4:56:54 PM] Kyrex AERO: Nope. To anyone that actually listens.
[11/4/22, 4:56:55 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: On other platforms too, once traffic increases the cost of validating each transaction increases which also increases the network fee
[11/4/22, 4:57:09 PM] DV Glory: 🌝
[11/4/22, 4:57:23 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: ETH network fee was not always been expensive
[11/4/22, 4:57:26 PM] Kyrex AERO: I’m being very objective here sha
[11/4/22, 4:57:40 PM] DV Glory: I remember I used to see ridiculous gas fee one time like that...
[11/4/22, 4:57:54 PM] Kyrex AERO: I’ve not paid higher than a dollar on any network not named ETH.
‎[11/4/22, 4:57:58 PM] Habeebulah:  ‎audio omitted
[11/4/22, 4:58:07 PM] DV Glory: Ehn ehn.
Exactly...
[11/4/22, 4:58:10 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Because the traffic is low
[11/4/22, 4:58:14 PM] Kyrex AERO: No matter the traffic.
[11/4/22, 4:58:43 PM] Kyrex AERO: Anything under ETH has this issue. 
And now they’re slowly improving it.
[11/4/22, 4:58:55 PM] Kyrex AERO: Lol okay o
[11/4/22, 4:59:43 PM] Kyrex AERO: Do your research sha
[11/4/22, 5:00:05 PM] DV Glory: Okay.
So tell me the process to use decentralised exchange...
[11/4/22, 5:00:10 PM] Kyrex AERO: Exactly
[11/4/22, 5:00:19 PM] Kyrex AERO: Literally open a wallet and go.
[11/4/22, 5:00:23 PM] Kyrex AERO: It’s that simple.
[11/4/22, 5:00:36 PM] Kyrex AERO: You only need a wallet.
‎[11/4/22, 5:02:49 PM] Kyrex AERO:  ‎audio omitted
[11/4/22, 5:04:07 PM] DV Glory: How'd you open a wallet¿
[11/4/22, 5:04:19 PM] Kyrex AERO: I explained here
[11/4/22, 5:04:45 PM] Habeebulah: Ehn. No ooo.
[11/4/22, 5:04:53 PM] DV Glory: Oh.
[11/4/22, 5:05:00 PM] Kyrex AERO: And you know the cool part of the wallet is you can have it on as many devices as you please.
[11/4/22, 5:05:16 PM] Kyrex AERO: Anywhere in the world.
[11/4/22, 5:05:42 PM] Kyrex AERO: Just have your key phrase. 

I literally have the same wallet on 5 devices.
[11/4/22, 5:05:50 PM] DV Glory: How do you find it
[11/4/22, 5:05:56 PM] DV Glory: Fund...
[11/4/22, 5:06:11 PM] Kyrex AERO: If I’m not on my main phone I can use someone else’s phone to run a quick transaction
[11/4/22, 5:06:33 PM] Kyrex AERO: Well that part is tricky here. We have bank issues that won’t allow you to.
[11/4/22, 5:06:58 PM] Kyrex AERO: So in that case you’ll have to find someone who has what you want and pay them based on their rate
[11/4/22, 5:07:08 PM] DV Glory: Exactly...
[11/4/22, 5:07:26 PM] Kyrex AERO: In a lot of countries they don’t

‎[11/4/22, 5:08:13 PM] Habeebulah:  ‎audio omitted
[11/4/22, 5:08:43 PM] DV Glory: The lack of tracking again, is something I am not cool with.

In fact, I make sure to always use transfer when I want to use POS, because the tracking is easier than using a card.
[11/4/22, 5:10:01 PM] DV Glory: Omo.
Now, what if someone makes a mistake with the address¿
[11/4/22, 5:10:17 PM] Kyrex AERO: No one said you can’t track. We’re saying unless you use a CEX, you can’t complain.
[11/4/22, 5:10:34 PM] Kyrex AERO: Gone
[11/4/22, 5:10:36 PM] Kyrex AERO: 😂😂😂
[11/4/22, 5:11:06 PM] DV Glory: You see.
Why then will I want to, if I'm not doing a sketchy transaction¿
[11/4/22, 5:11:13 PM] Kyrex AERO: I’m not even saying this thing doesn’t have disadvantages. I’m saying there a lot of advantages.
[11/4/22, 5:12:19 PM] Kyrex AERO: Something’s gotta give
[11/4/22, 5:12:32 PM] Kyrex AERO: If it’s not for you, cool 😎
‎[11/4/22, 5:13:18 PM] DV Glory:  ‎audio omitted
[11/4/22, 5:14:19 PM] DV Glory: The real question is, is it for the average human¿

The real reason crypto picked up was because of people using it as an investment. And hoping to get quick money from it.
[11/4/22, 5:14:41 PM] Kyrex AERO: People said the same for the internet.
[11/4/22, 5:15:09 PM] Kyrex AERO: So depends on which narrative you choose to believe really
[11/4/22, 5:15:39 PM] DV Glory: The internet was solving a real problem.

Crypto is solving subjective problems.
[11/4/22, 5:17:03 PM] Habeebulah: Hence the decentralisation. O ti lo
[11/4/22, 5:17:47 PM] Kyrex AERO: Well I’ve been transacting for like 10 months. Haven’t made a mistake on transfers. Matter of fact, most people don’t have this said issue of making a mistake with wallets because you don’t have to rely on memory or type it out, you just have to copy paste it from your wallet, there’s no reliance on memory. Just double check. Same thing you would do when you’re sending money to someone.
[11/4/22, 5:18:33 PM] Kyrex AERO: So the being able to send money anywhere in the world without going through the processes is subjective?
[11/4/22, 5:19:09 PM] Kyrex AERO: You’re focusing too much on downsides. I can’t change your mindset on that. 

As much as I can.
[11/4/22, 5:19:25 PM] Kyrex AERO: …try
‎[11/4/22, 5:19:28 PM] Habeebulah:  ‎video omitted
[11/4/22, 5:21:49 PM] DV Glory: Omo.
I'm sure people make mistakes.
[11/4/22, 5:22:20 PM] DV Glory: Welp.
I'm just trying to see if it can achieve mass adoption.
[11/4/22, 5:22:22 PM] Kyrex AERO: definitely, as long as it doesn’t happen every time. It’s not as big of an issue.
[11/4/22, 5:26:24 PM] Kyrex AERO: Based on how the structures are, most likely not. Threatens too much of things so that’s a factor.
[11/4/22, 5:26:34 PM] DV Glory: Yep.
Nevertheless, I hope you realise how deep ID is integral to our society.

Personally, I wouldn't be okay with transactions without faces.
I feel the persons it's really of an advantage to are criminals.
[11/4/22, 5:27:02 PM] DV Glory: Exactly...
[11/4/22, 5:29:23 PM] Kyrex AERO: With systems comes flaws 

The internet brought the rise in identity theft, money laundering, cybercrimes, you can name it. So we can argue the internet also gave criminals an advantage. 

That’s why I’d rather not delve too much on downsides.
[11/4/22, 5:29:58 PM] DV Glory: Hmmmn.
Fair point.

[11/15/22, 10:24:24 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: 1) They posted you to Sokoto, I mean really? Make them burn you overnight ba because you said something innocent in a group chat? Or make herdsmen kidnap you on the way sef

2) Those are negligible corruptions that can be found in very country, no system is perfect.

3) An entire country said there is shortage of passport I have an urgent business meeting in Miami. So I should wait till your government sorts out their bullshit right?

4) Some people are just mad naturally, how you go get driver's license when you can't drive 😂? That is the fault of a structure. Again it happens in most countries, that's why we have judicial systems.

5) When the hiring manager said he is selling his slot, I should not pay abiii? 10 years after graduation no job.

I still maintain, crime and corruption automatically reduces in a system that works. It starts at the top.

[11/15/22, 10:32:42 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: People were robbed by herdsmen at gunpoint barely an hour after we passed VOM highway on the way to Plateau State. 

You think those people will stay?

21 days in camp, special forces came 7 times because several killings were occuring in Jos North and some local governments near our camp

[11/19/22, 6:50:59 PM] Teslim Cyborg: I think this question is wrong 
All Obi fans think supporting tinubu is tantamount to not having Nigeria’s best interest at heart
It’s wrong 
Tinubu’s presidency should he get there would be largely dependent on his team 
Ministers and all that
If he manages to select the best hands 
Nigeria would be fine 


So please
Stop this thing 
It irks me lowkey 


I’m a realist 
I don’t care much for any of them as I’ve always said 
Let’s just all try to hope the best man gets there and let’s campaign without undermining others
[11/19/22, 6:50:59 PM] Abdulraheem: Why you wan vote for tinubu…from which standpoint do you think that this man is right person for seat?

That seat isn’t just as straightforward or as direct as they’re making it seem 
It’s not
[11/19/22, 7:05:18 PM] Abdulraheem: Some people are just being sentimental following tinubu as their candidate. It quite understandable that you to remain your loyal to a man that helped a lot of families and given a whole lot to some regions of the country. If this man is physically fit and mentally stable I’m sure I would consider him as one of the candidates I would vote for but unfortunately he’s not. He’s too weak to carry Nigeria problem well that’s my opinion on him
[11/19/22, 7:05:55 PM] ‪+234 902 994 6259‬: Exactly
It's more complicated Dan they present it during campaign once dey get d office, someone comes with we didn't tell u this or that

A lot are not discussed until dey get d office den different forces starts navigating d president.

Den rather Dan tinking abt saving d country, he starts playing roles for survival in office
[11/19/22, 7:06:28 PM] Teslim Cyborg: You’re entitled to this your opinion 
Nobody is asking you stupid questions like do you have the best interest of Nigeria at heart 



I’d need you to also replicate that energy

[11/19/22, 7:17:37 PM] Abdulraheem: I think this buhari tenure is an eye opener for people to vehemently ready to be responsible for whoever they wanted as the new president of Nigeria esp the educated ones because Nigeria matter is beyond capping during campaign. We need a faithful, strong, creative and ambitious person as the next president. The question is who is now the right person out of these people aspiring for the post
[11/19/22, 7:23:26 PM] ‪+234 902 994 6259‬: Question only God can answer
God HIMSELF gave Israel a King called Saul but he failed.
Even King David made mistakes BC he too is a human and has limitless desires

King Solomon d wisest King made mistakes BC of his wives too

So none of them is d best. Since they will encounter human influence 


Voting for d best will hurt you wen dey fail tomorrow oo

If Nigeria were to be a kingdom he would've handed over to his son already cause he s too old and his chiefs will easily replace his race
[11/19/22, 7:52:01 PM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Stop writing off “OLD” like it’s an insignificant point 

We don’t care about his bridges 

His bridges are only there for self interest and not the interest of Nigerians 

You’re trying to paint someone that the mechanisms he has in place are just to line his pockets in a good light

Since then
They have always heavily inflated their numbers 
Because they want more resources

This your agenda is not agendering

It’s easier to sell PO than it is to sell Tinubu 
Tinubu is still strongly the favorite
And to be very honest 
He’s the one that will win
But it’s all because he has the right connections and he has paid his due
It’s not because he’s best suited for the job

North west and north east 
He’d be almost non existent there

[11/20/22, 11:47:59 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Very valid reason to support him
[11/20/22, 11:48:11 PM] DV Glory: Lol.
I wouldn't say he doesn't, because I'm not all knowing. But where I have problem with you is trying to project it unto him without actually factual solid concrete cemented proofs.
[11/20/22, 11:49:14 PM] Westbrown🔩⚙️: @2348038879196 l like tinubu, he is a man to truth ...he gives, and he has good person but considering his health situation I can't risk my vote for him.

But I’m tired of having a ghost for a President
I see how other presidents are proactive 
Even 80yr old Biden 
I don’t want a ghost London based President again who will put the country in the hands of others

He himself couldn't believe wat he met or do anything abt it.

Y did he keep mentioning "fighting corruption" wen Goodluck and OB left same office without mentioning need for fighting corruption?
[11/20/22, 11:57:05 PM] Gbogo: This is a lie. Buhari rarely spoke to the media I guarantee less than 10 interviews. Buhari proxies gave us promises not buhari directly. Peter obi is the one speaking to nigeria not proxies and granting interviews. There's a huge difference
[11/20/22, 11:57:56 PM] Teslim Cyborg: It’s not a your own view😂😂😂
It’s a worldwide view

You’re selling us dreams my bro

[11/20/22, 11:59:43 PM] Gbogo: There's no way to defend buhari. That man is corrupt as hell. 8 months assu strike nobody was sacked. Prison break for abuja nobody was sacked, oil theft nobody was sacked, naira crumbling nobody was sacked. So when there no punishment for bad behaviour why stop?. Buhari is corrupt also

It means he’d do all he’s saying he would ?

And when I said Buhari told us 
I obviously meant Buhari and his campaign team


I’m not even asking you to rate anything I’m saying 
I’m a realist 
I like truth 
Obi is giving false promises vibe 
FTX things as @2348142837502 rightly mentioned 

Do with that what you will
I understand you’re angry about how Nigeria is 
You want solution

But that emotion is what Obi is riding on 
He’s telling you all what you want to hear
And I’ve been in Nigeria all my life to know politicians cap a whole forken lot

I said it in our game group chat 

If Tinubu was more healthy, I no go get problem giving him my vote
[11/21/22, 12:14:08 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Okay good

See the way Obi left PDP cause Atiku was already bodying him with money moves ?
So if tinubu left APC to let’s say SDP 
Would that have been better ?
[11/21/22, 12:14:33 AM] Habeebulah: Word
[11/21/22, 12:14:38 AM] Abdulraheem: Exactly
[11/21/22, 12:15:12 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Have in mind 
LP  has 5 principal officers 
4 of them have been in PDP at some time

The presidential and Vice Presidential candidate too

So LP is like and extension of PDP
@2348161712227
[11/21/22, 12:15:16 AM] Gbogo: Honestly yes. Cos at the basic minimum he would admit buhari has been a colossal failure. But health , character and corruption allegations still remains

I don’t rate parties
Cause at the end all of them are the same
They change parties like changing clothes 
They’ve bastardized that party system 


Tackle the individual 
Not party 

PDP was a failure during Jonathan’s tenure 
And if Atiku had not played money politics 
Obi would have been flying their flag
So would that mean Obi is also liable to be tied to PDP’s past failure ?
[11/21/22, 12:19:13 AM] Abdulraheem: Well oloriburuku go oloriburuku irrespective of the legacy of the party he or she belongs

Shey changing party woood change the individual ni 
Lmao
Abeg
[11/21/22, 12:20:33 AM] Gbogo: You are mixing things up. Cos at the end of the day party also matters. 
Pdp was a failure during Jonathan yes and yes obi would have been liable. Cos that's just how politics works.

So Tinubu at SDP>>>> Tinubu at APC?

APC=SDP=PDP=LP
[11/21/22, 12:22:28 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: So yeah you can tie an individual to the party's bad past, if the individual is bad
[11/21/22, 12:23:02 AM] Gbogo: It's  complicated. Sdp doesn't have apc structure. And tinubu isn't a sellable candidate so not really
[11/21/22, 12:23:27 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Na why I use Obi as example
We all call him a good man
Yes, I used we


But if he was in PDP would we still refer to him as a good man 
Have in mind LP people were in PDP
[11/21/22, 12:23:31 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Tinubu anywhere will still be a bad choice
[11/21/22, 12:24:00 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes we would still refer to him as a good man, remember people were supporting him in PDP till PDP fucked up

Tinubu actually graduated from Chicago state university 
With distinction
He’s not a wanted man for drugs in the United States 
In fact he has never been

No be me talk am
It’s Reno Omokri with facts on Atise TV
He went to Chicago state university himself to confirm

I’m watching it
[11/22/22, 10:28:18 AM] DV Glory: Lol.
Obviously was more healthy than Tinubu even until the time of her death.
Whereas she's mostly ceremonial... Your comparison is out of place.
[11/22/22, 10:28:38 AM] Teslim Cyborg: This forfeiture 
It was explained
But my issue with most of shallow minded people on this group is 
When I start explaining
They say I’m supporting him or stuff like that 
And I’m sure I’d get pissed 

So let me rather not explain that 


But again
Me I just speak the truth

Tinubu should be retired on an island drinking magarita and doing his baba isale 
He has no business being our president
You can’t tell me he worked for it 
He wants to be that president because of his own personal fulfillment 
Not because of any other thing 
Not because he has the best interest of you and I at heart

I has no plan for us if he had he wouldn't have said "if borrowing is a crime Nigerians should stop using Benz and Lexus" someone aspiring to be a President of a country sinking in debt already oo

Even if he wins today and naturally or artificially he is moved out of d way Boko Lord automatically becomes d no1

We can forget his past now but I can't vote for an old man anymore especially dat age
[11/22/22, 10:44:56 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Why are y’all calling Shettima boko lord

I’m interested in knowing why 
He sponsored boko haram

[11/22/22, 10:51:15 AM] Teslim Cyborg: 😭😭😭😭
And you accuse another man of propaganda
[11/22/22, 10:51:55 AM] Teslim Cyborg: He’s hiding something 🌚
[11/22/22, 10:52:10 AM] Gbogo: Lol what's propaganda there. Where there's no fact I said rumour has it. But also its fact that tinubu had 1.8 million dollars with his only know source of income was an accountant. I have fact for that
[11/22/22, 10:52:11 AM] ‪+234 902 994 6259‬: Wait for it Sir

[11/22/22, 10:52:56 AM] Gbogo: With monthly salary of 2400 dollars
[11/22/22, 10:53:26 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Very valid question 


What do you think he did to get his money ?
[11/22/22, 10:54:23 AM] Gbogo: It's easy to know it's not legal at least. Money doesn't just appear. And the account has drugs links. At least its on document is sent 100k dollars to a know drug dealer. Its not hard to put 2 and 2 together
[11/22/22, 10:56:35 AM] ‪+234 902 994 6259‬: OK boss

[11/22/22, 11:01:00 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Literate would think about having him and there’s nothing you or anybody can do about trust
[11/22/22, 11:01:01 AM] Teslim Cyborg: That*
[11/22/22, 11:02:22 AM] Gbogo: Lol. Then you you benefit from this present system. That's all. If I did also I might understand.

[11/22/22, 7:45:36 PM] Habeebulah: At all
[11/22/22, 7:45:55 PM] Habeebulah: No one expected it. But the coach used nice tactics sha
[11/22/22, 7:46:00 PM] Quadri: Outwitted maybe. 
With a touch of luck. 
Saudi had a game plan that worked for them In the first half.
[11/22/22, 7:46:13 PM] Habeebulah: Yeah
[11/22/22, 7:46:38 PM] Habeebulah: Look at that second martinez goal that was cancelled. The thing would have been declared goal if not for VAR
[11/22/22, 7:49:39 PM] Abdulraheem: Nah it would have ruined them in first half.  keeping high line is very risky. I’m sure they would have lost to Manchester United if it was against them. Argentina didn’t adjust to that tactic and that made it worked well
[11/22/22, 7:50:43 PM] Quadri: Heartbreaking.
[11/22/22, 7:51:18 PM] Quadri: But it didn’t. 
It was their game plan. 
The high line. 
They stuck to it. 
It worked. 
Simple.
[11/22/22, 7:52:41 PM] Habeebulah: Their attackers(Argentina) weren't tall so playing counter would have been hard
[11/22/22, 7:53:35 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: But there is VAR so it's not a goal 😃. It's just like saying, if not that people didn't vote for Goodluck he could have been president 🤷🏽‍♂️
[11/22/22, 7:53:37 PM] Abdulraheem: Remember counter attack is not always playing up ball
[11/22/22, 7:53:50 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: Counter is about speed
[11/22/22, 7:54:13 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: I don't remember them playing any slow guy up front
[11/22/22, 7:54:17 PM] Habeebulah: Well true sha
[11/22/22, 7:54:37 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Who’s considered “a fast player” in that Argentina squad
[11/22/22, 7:54:42 PM] Habeebulah: I am not saying Saudi didn't deserve their win
[11/22/22, 7:55:16 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: The good thing about their opponent was that they understood their high line VAR turned up too and they took their chances
[11/22/22, 7:55:23 PM] Habeebulah: I am just saying that it was very close
[11/22/22, 7:56:18 PM] Abdulraheem: What if Messi, Martinez wasn’t an offside, it’s a tactic that can’t work for most teams cos it only requires a good passer to make a calculative pass
[11/22/22, 7:56:39 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: Latauro is fast
[11/22/22, 7:56:52 PM] Abdulraheem: Argentina failed to capitalize on that. Otilo
[11/22/22, 7:57:13 PM] Teslim Cyborg: No he’s not
[11/22/22, 7:57:41 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Rashford is fast 
Mbappe is fast 
Dembele is fast 
Bale is fast 


Lautauro isn’t in that conversation
[11/22/22, 7:58:19 PM] Abdulraheem: That’s why I said Saudi can’t use that shit against a team like Man U or PSG
[11/22/22, 7:58:47 PM] Teslim Cyborg: Or against France
[11/22/22, 7:58:50 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: He's not considered slow, he has 89 speed on fifa

[11/22/22, 8:02:56 PM] Abdulraheem: Team wey win no better before even if they didn’t play anything that’s what matters

[11/22/22, 8:04:17 PM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: But as things stand I'll make that bold prediction that Argentina might be the no3 team in that group

[11/22/22, 8:19:43 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: And talking about a player flop does not mean hating man

[11/22/22, 8:21:09 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: That one too have been rubbish this season
[11/22/22, 8:21:43 PM] Abdulraheem: Oda motigbo. Currently with Ronaldo situation Messi would never be at peace
[11/22/22, 8:22:13 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: Same thing Messi did last season against Madrid. He just ghost when they needed him
[11/22/22, 8:22:37 PM] Habeebulah: He didn't have the capacity
[11/22/22, 8:22:39 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: The same way Ronaldo too was never at peace last season
[11/22/22, 8:22:41 PM] Abdulraheem: He has proved himself so many times…he has nothing to prove again
[11/22/22, 8:23:01 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: To always ghost when he is being needed
[11/22/22, 8:23:16 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: Moreover we can say this for Ronaldo too
[11/22/22, 8:24:02 PM] Abdulraheem: So when he did played beautifully they didn’t need him. It’s now personal interest
[11/22/22, 8:24:50 PM] Abdulraheem: Arguably yes he has nothing to prove to anybody again
[11/22/22, 8:26:35 PM] Abdulraheem: Let talk about psg. Messi has been playing beautifully for them. Say, a match now come where he didn’t perform well, you will have to say he didn’t perform when they needed him
[11/22/22, 8:27:06 PM] Abdulraheem: We fans speak with emotion a lot and I understand where it’s coming from
[11/22/22, 8:27:07 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: Just trolling him tho.
[11/22/22, 8:27:26 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: I am not emotional, just trying to enjoy myself

But Jumia for drugs...
[11/22/22, 9:03:27 PM] Habeebulah: Explain please
[11/22/22, 9:07:58 PM] DV Glory: 1. Make sure you have the best drugs. Because referrals will be your only means of advertisement.
2. Use despatchers.
3. Never dispatch from same address.
4. Run a website that can only be accessed using VPN.
5. Collect all payments in BTC

These are just ideas... I'm sure there are ways to run it effectively if more thought is put into it.
[11/22/22, 9:08:40 PM] DV Glory: Dispatchers*
[11/22/22, 9:09:01 PM] Habeebulah: Okay. You meant the business would be like jumia
[11/22/22, 9:09:10 PM] DV Glory: Yep.
[11/22/22, 9:10:14 PM] Habeebulah: Great. But then, dispatchers might be an issue. Site anonymosity can make feds order to and arrest the dispatcher
[11/22/22, 9:12:15 PM] Teslim Cyborg: You aren’t giving the dispatchers directly
They’d go pick it up somewhere
[11/22/22, 9:12:41 PM] Teslim Cyborg: They do not know who is selling the drugs 
They just know who they’re delivering to
[11/22/22, 9:12:56 PM] DV Glory: 😂
Wahala for dispatcher oo...
[11/22/22, 9:13:12 PM] DV Glory: Yep.

[11/28/22, 2:56:18 PM] DV Glory: Actually. What I have understood so far from the way you talk is...
You support Tinubu based on very old Precedence (which doesn't represent the Tinubu of today) and Political Weight.
The flaw in supporting someone because of political weight is actually obvious. Supporting someone because you think they will win (and this I believe is why people have assumed you have something to gain).

*Ideally* you should support someone because he or she is best.

You could believe he's the best in your opinion. But when it comes to debates, debates are to be done objectively. Which means you can mostly proof your statements.

An example is religion. Any thorough thinking person knows religious beliefs can't be proven objectively. So, it would actually be stupid to bring religion to the objective floor of debate without having to acknowledge some "unproofables".

[11/29/22, 6:52:43 AM] DV Glory: Yep.
Luck is a very important variable to play at the top. But lack of it doesn't mean you wouldn't be successful.
Hardwork has more weight than luck.
PS: Definition of Hardwork can be subjective, some will posit that a cement labourer is more hardworking than Tony. 🙃
[11/29/22, 6:53:22 AM] DV Glory: https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I
[11/29/22, 8:50:04 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Pure luck, plays a role in success. There are variables you cannot explain or control. Where you are born for example? Your family another example? Those things are just luck
[11/29/22, 8:51:13 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: And they play the greatest role in success. Bill Gates had enough resources to build Microsoft, enough sef, more than enough. Mark Zuckerberg had parents willing to pay over 10,000usd for for coding classes, Jeff Bezos had parents who migrated to the US when he was little
[11/29/22, 8:55:33 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Greatest role why?

They set the playing field that determines the value of your hard work. Hardwork has degrees of value, someone working 80 hours in Nigeria is never the same as someone working 80 hours in the UK or US. Just because you are in Nigeria already put you at a disadvantage
[11/29/22, 8:56:05 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Just because you have Bala blu contesting again sef, na another variable in the equation that puts you at a disadvantage should he win
[11/29/22, 8:58:16 AM] DV Glory: This is where it gets interesting...
There were definitely other people that had these "Lucks" too...

Would you now say "luck alone can make success"¿

I would still lean towards the statement that "Hardwork alone can make success".

The problem now lies in fact that success is usually termed subjective. (This in itself is a debate 🥲).
[11/29/22, 9:04:50 AM] Kyrex AERO: They work in tandem. 

No matter how hard you work, you still need luck. 

We can objectify success to being financially stable in the sense that you can afford to live your life and afford a family. The figure that will make this work for each person is obviously different but the parameter can be the same. If you have those met, you’re automatically above the average. That’s objectifying it. Everything else is add-ons and superficial.
[11/29/22, 9:11:28 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Luck with Hardwork makes for success, I have never see anyone with these two who are not successful
[11/29/22, 9:12:02 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Often times luck without hardwork also makes for success, just that it doesn't last. Remember *hardwork* not just *work*
[11/29/22, 9:12:23 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: How do you manipulate your luck ?
[11/29/22, 9:13:53 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Of course there will always be *people*, give me examples of those people like I gave you mine
[11/29/22, 9:14:22 AM] Kyrex AERO: You mean engineer.
[11/29/22, 9:14:39 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: No, I mean manipulate
[11/29/22, 9:14:47 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I go buy soap
[11/29/22, 9:15:04 AM] Kyrex AERO: 💯
[11/29/22, 9:18:53 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: When you say the definition of hardwork is subjective, you even begin another phase of debate, because it's subjectivity was defined by luck. Think about it.

How hard can someone from a poor background possibly work in a corruption drenched country to make his first billion?
[11/29/22, 9:19:48 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: For the purpose of this argument, let's set one billion dollars as the benchmark for success.
[11/29/22, 9:19:54 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Or even naira sef
[11/29/22, 9:25:06 AM] DV Glory: Nice.
Hmmmn...
‎[11/29/22, 9:25:37 AM] Kyrex AERO:  ‎sticker omitted
[11/29/22, 9:25:57 AM] Kyrex AERO: Putting a figure on it is the problem itself for me sha.
[11/29/22, 9:27:25 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: How do you define success?
[11/29/22, 9:29:10 AM] Kyrex AERO: Cause considering the fact that a lot of people struggle to feed, don’t have education, don’t have jobs or any source of income. It’ll be very ungrateful to have those and feel like you’re a failure in some sense which is what a lot of people do. 

Media has falsified the narrative and made it look like if you don’t have this car or those clothes or the genetically impossible wife, you’re not succeeding in life all in the name of selling their product, they don’t really give a shit past that. It’s all a manipulative gimmick.
[11/29/22, 9:29:28 AM] Kyrex AERO: @2347062037265 latter part of this.
[11/29/22, 9:30:49 AM] Kyrex AERO: Just walk outside and look around you. That’s enough to let you know you’re doing good.
[11/29/22, 9:31:13 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I understand, means everyone is successful then
[11/29/22, 9:31:31 AM] Kyrex AERO: Not everyone o lol
[11/29/22, 9:31:46 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: That itself defies the exclusivity definition of success
[11/29/22, 9:32:25 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: It's supposed to be *exclusive*, that's what makes it worth attaining, there has to be a price tag attached that only but a few can pay, thus defines  them as successful
[11/29/22, 9:32:37 AM] Kyrex AERO: Afford to live your life and possibly afford a family. 

A lot of people can’t even meet the first part, not to talk of the second. Debt, no source of income etc.
[11/29/22, 9:33:05 AM] Kyrex AERO: So you’re swinging towards the superficial side of things. 

Fair enough.
[11/29/22, 9:33:29 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: 😂, I am being realistic.
[11/29/22, 9:33:38 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Being fulfilled is different from being successful
[11/29/22, 9:33:37 AM] Kyrex AERO: Not really.
[11/29/22, 9:33:47 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Hope you know @2349039472101
[11/29/22, 9:33:51 AM] Flyiin~Wingz: none of you is as rich as Tony, why argue his words. only the likes of otedola e.t.c should... Luck plays a bigger role, hardwork play less to it.
[11/29/22, 9:34:00 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Tor 😂
[11/29/22, 9:34:32 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: This is being fulfilled, success is measured by impact. You can't call yourself successful, it's people that calls you successful
[11/29/22, 9:34:47 AM] Kyrex AERO: Ok o
[11/29/22, 9:34:50 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: On the other hand you can always wake up at 30 and decide you are fulfilled, whatever your metrics for that are
[11/29/22, 9:35:56 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: This defines over 60% of people as being successful
[11/29/22, 9:36:13 AM] Kyrex AERO: *in life* yes.
[11/29/22, 9:36:20 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: In developed countries, the number is even higher
[11/29/22, 9:36:24 AM] Kyrex AERO: If you really value what you have sha.
[11/29/22, 9:36:27 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: How do you define fulfillment?
[11/29/22, 9:36:55 AM] Kyrex AERO: It’s the numbers thinking that breeds corruption and every other thing that the world is facing.
[11/29/22, 9:37:28 AM] DV Glory: I think only Hardwork will achieve this.
[11/29/22, 9:38:02 AM] Kyrex AERO: You can’t not have luck. Except luck doesn’t exist.
[11/29/22, 9:38:46 AM] Kyrex AERO: If you don’t have any luck then you’re not succeeding at anything. 

Living sef na luck, anything can happen.
[11/29/22, 9:38:53 AM] DV Glory: 🌝
[11/29/22, 9:38:53 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: No it's not the numbers thinking, it's just about how many kids did you offer free education? How many of those _*help us we need financial help for surgery*_ did you finance? Whose life did you completely change? 

Affording to live your life and a family doesn't help you achieve this.
[11/29/22, 9:39:02 AM] Flyiin~Wingz: 😏
[11/29/22, 9:39:14 AM] Kyrex AERO: Leave am
[11/29/22, 9:39:38 AM] DV Glory: I know people that term their Professorship as success.
I don't see it as such... Especially if it's a Nigerian Professor. 🙃
[11/29/22, 9:39:51 AM] Kyrex AERO: If it’s not the numbers thinking then explain why people will millions will want to embezzle. They’re already well off.
[11/29/22, 9:40:18 AM] Kyrex AERO: Or why people cut costs to do things.
[11/29/22, 9:40:19 AM] DV Glory: Genetically impossible wife.
😂
[11/29/22, 9:40:31 AM] Kyrex AERO: Or why people want war so they can profit off it.
[11/29/22, 9:40:32 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Again thank you to our environment, in saner systems, this is not usually the order of the day
[11/29/22, 9:40:54 AM] Kyrex AERO: There’s corruption everywhere.
[11/29/22, 9:40:57 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Again, that might be someone's definition of fulfillment
[11/29/22, 9:41:02 AM] Kyrex AERO: This you know.
[11/29/22, 9:41:09 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes but not on the same scale and magnitude
[11/29/22, 9:41:23 AM] Kyrex AERO: Doesn’t negate the fact that there is though
[11/29/22, 9:41:32 AM] DV Glory: This subjectivity Na something... 🥲
[11/29/22, 9:41:46 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Bribing a traffic cop is different from bribing a judge, or manipulating an entire country
[11/29/22, 9:42:14 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Lol now you are generalising, c'mon you know better.
[11/29/22, 9:42:42 AM] Kyrex AERO: And na the best way to objectify am I don bring. Put a number on it and somewhere else somewhere will tell you that’s poor. 

For billions of year how did humans survive? On millions in their bank account?
[11/29/22, 9:42:48 AM] DV Glory: Hmm.
I think the subjectivity of success actually comes from the concept of Fulfillment.
[11/29/22, 9:42:52 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: No system is perfect we know that
[11/29/22, 9:42:54 AM] Kyrex AERO: Simple.
[11/29/22, 9:43:33 AM] Kyrex AERO: Again. As humans in life.
[11/29/22, 9:43:35 AM] DV Glory: There are also richer guys that will debate his words. 🥲
[11/29/22, 9:43:51 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Omooo mo ti gbo, everyone is successful nigbayen. Atii Elon Musk atii landlord mii, all of them
[11/29/22, 9:44:00 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Nothing separates those that have achieved more
[11/29/22, 9:44:09 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Wanting to achieve more sef is therefore pointless
[11/29/22, 9:44:14 AM] Kyrex AERO: @2347062037265 what’s your number then.
[11/29/22, 9:44:21 AM] Kyrex AERO: in dollars.
[11/29/22, 9:44:44 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: My metric for determining success is not money, it's impact.
[11/29/22, 9:44:57 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Is Mahatma Gandhi successful? Yes
[11/29/22, 9:44:58 AM] DV Glory: Hmmmn.
This again is subjective.
Nigerians might call you successfully, but Americans might not.
[11/29/22, 9:45:09 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Was he rich? No
[11/29/22, 9:45:19 AM] Kyrex AERO: So why discard my own argument for success then lol
[11/29/22, 9:45:35 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Was Martin Luther King Jnr successful? Yes. Was he rich? No
[11/29/22, 9:46:04 AM] DV Glory: Fair enough...
[11/29/22, 9:46:35 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Your argument doesn't work in real life, for the purpose of motivation yes, but realistically? No.

How many lives are you able to impact is my personal metric like I said, having dollars helps you do that, living life for you doesn't.
[11/29/22, 9:47:56 AM] Kyrex AERO: Except you’re misunderstanding my points sha. 

Cause this is soooo real.
[11/29/22, 9:48:30 AM] Kyrex AERO: Because that’s what most families survive on.
[11/29/22, 9:48:52 AM] Kyrex AERO: Being able to
[11/29/22, 9:49:00 AM] DV Glory: 😂
[11/29/22, 9:49:37 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: They work in tandem. 

No matter how hard you work, you still need luck. 

We can objectify success to being financially stable in the sense that you can afford to live your life and afford a family. The figure that will make this work for each person is obviously different but the parameter can be the same. If you have those met, *you’re automatically above the average* . That’s objectifying it. Everything else is add-ons and superficial.

The definition of *living above average* is also subjective 🌚. In US it could mean paying off your mortgage and owning a Tesla, in Nigeria it could mean surviving a day in Lagos 😃
[11/29/22, 9:49:53 AM] DV Glory: Okay. This actually is mine too...

@2349030543756 I think you were the one that posted one guy that wanted to be very rich, but wasn't able to...
[11/29/22, 9:50:11 AM] Kyrex AERO: …being financially stable in the sense that you can afford to live your life and afford a family. The figure that will make this work for each person is obviously different but the parameter can be the same…
[11/29/22, 9:50:27 AM] Kyrex AERO: How’s that not real
[11/29/22, 9:50:28 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Is your definition of success?
[11/29/22, 9:50:37 AM] Kyrex AERO: Yep.
[11/29/22, 9:50:46 AM] Kyrex AERO: For a human species. Yes.
[11/29/22, 9:51:01 AM] Kyrex AERO: That’s what has worked for ages.
[11/29/22, 9:51:05 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Cool, nothing else? Everyone should just try to do that yeah?
[11/29/22, 9:51:27 AM] Kyrex AERO: And by the way the latter part of this I addressed.
[11/29/22, 9:52:21 AM] Kyrex AERO: *The figure that will make this work is obviously different*
[11/29/22, 9:52:23 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: In Nigeria yes. But don't tell that to those who industrialised America, fought for black freedom or developed computing. 

If everyone *just tried to live their life and afford a family* , you go get phone to type so? 😂
[11/29/22, 9:52:55 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: We wouldn't have had visionaries and inventors o
[11/29/22, 9:53:00 AM] Kyrex AERO: This has automatically considered different places or scenarios
[11/29/22, 9:53:37 AM] Kyrex AERO: Then you didn’t get my point then.
[11/29/22, 9:53:44 AM] Kyrex AERO: Cause it was quite simple.
[11/29/22, 9:54:00 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: You mean the minimum criteria for success then?
[11/29/22, 9:54:24 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Or the absolute criteria for success?
[11/29/22, 9:54:52 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: This means someone can always be more successful.
[11/29/22, 9:55:00 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: This means we are all equally successful
[11/29/22, 9:55:46 AM] Kyrex AERO: 1. Financially stable 
2. Afford to live your life and afford a family 
3. The figure that will make this work is obviously different for each person. 

If that doesn’t make it clear enough I really don’t know what to say.
[11/29/22, 10:02:25 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I think it's okay we agree to disagree, because me I no agree to this one.

 *Impact*  is my metric, maximum impact, leaving the human race better than I met it. Anobi Muhammad (SAW) did that, Jesus did that (Please the Lord). It's beyond financial stability, it's beyond money, it's beyond your life and family.
[11/29/22, 10:12:22 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: My metric is happiness

If I say something now some of you ur mind is too small to understand and will start throwing insult from ur comfort zone.
[12/5/22, 12:31:51 PM] ‪+234 803 887 9196‬: Mayb y am even saying all this is bcoz am close to people who discuss politics and knows what goes around from source, let's assume PO win take it or leave it, the government will b difficult for him to control coz only him can't do the work, exactly what happened when buhari entered then 2015 we knew him as a principle and discipline candidate to help us get out of corruption, insecurities and other atrocities happening at that time but to fight corruption you have to be ready coz corruption will fight back and that was what happened, where d president was almost kill his ADC died from the incident, some even believe he is dead, imagine buhari a former Army General. Remember Buhari first term the Senate gave him a lot of problem signing bills,Laws that will benefit Nigeria citizen just because the money they collect b4 passing such bill from FG is stop from buhari d likes of Saraki having issues with d president. So tell me how many senators or house of rep do think LP are going to get from their Structure, when we have PDP and APC. LP that their structure is not that Solid so this are things we should put into consideration. Assuming PO wins it's either he dance to their tone and if he is stubborn de make the government difficult for him.

[12/5/22, 12:38:45 PM] Abdulraheem: A nostalgic standpoint here. You just want the legacy of corruption to continue erupting, which tune are you talking about, the tune we want no more.

[12/5/22, 12:45:24 PM] ‪+234 803 887 9196‬: In my opinion I believe that Tinubu can build the team that can fix things in this country because those he brought to limelight in government we c their relevance in politics and where they are today,the question is how many leaders or people has PO brought into politics and where they are today, how many allies does PO has in the North, south west, and even East, and you think he can run the affairs of this country smoothly in the presence of the cabal, Now Tinubu is going round the country to campaign and make alliance with each state traditional leaders, later if he wins now opposition will say rigging when He is going round the country they think it's a joke.
[12/5/22, 12:46:41 PM] ‪+234 803 887 9196‬: PO was a former PDP VP candidate in last election.he left PDP because he was muzzle out, he was denied d VP seat thats Y he join LP for the Presidency ticket, and I can tell you when he was governor of Anambra he didn't enter through LP ticket he was APGA, only him Fa. so it's funny when some Obidient term to c him as the only best because he is saying what they want to hear they forget All politician have sweet mouth for what they want, a typical example he started with he only has 2 wrist watch and 2 pairs of shoes and alot of talks that when you listen to it and try to assimilate you will that it makes no sense.
[12/5/22, 12:46:58 PM] Habeebulah: Don't you understand what I am saying? I am saying his health condition might not make him so. With the way Naija is, someone with superb health will have a hard time talk less of someone without it

[12/5/22, 12:47:41 PM] Jamo Villa Baba: @2348038879196, let’s look at it from this perspective, we have tried APC, and PDP, and they don’t work out. Is there any harm in trying another party? We clearly saw that the system involving those 2 parties are not giving us a good result.
Tinubu has always been involved in the APC shit one way or the other, he will still work with almost the same people on ground considering he actually gave most of that that post as he claimed. 
Just new thing.
[12/5/22, 12:49:25 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: His logic is corruption can drive out corruption 😂😹😹
[12/5/22, 12:50:40 PM] Abdulraheem: Bringing people to limelight doesn’t mean you have the same personality as them. Don’t be deceived by stuffs like that. Think outside the box, it helps a lot
[12/5/22, 12:50:43 PM] ‪+234 803 887 9196‬: My support for Tinubu is not because he is perfect.

Just came across this and I feel it's worthy to share 60% of what he said here I believe is correct and I have said them b4 now.

Festus Keyamo (SAN) has listed *10 reasons why he believes that the 2023 presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi is deceiving the electorate*
On Wednesday, in a statement made available to the Press, Keyamo outlined ten major reasons why the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) strongly believes that it is Obi and his party that are insulting the sensibilities of Nigerians and taking them as fools.
The full statement reads “It is Peter Obi and Labour Party that are insulting Nigerians and taking them to be fools for the following reasons.

1. Labour Party and Peter Obi wants Nigerians to rely on what is inside the brain of Peter Obi and what he says only by words of mouth instead of producing a manifesto for scrutiny. That is an insult to millions of Nigerians.

2. Peter Obi and Labour Party are disguising as ‘new breeds’, whereas just a few months ago Peter Obi was in the same PDP that enthroned one of the worst period of corruption and profligacy in our country and which party they now insult on a daily basis; for the records Peter Obi did not leave PDP out of principles; he left out of personal frustration when he was muzzled out. That is why he has been likened to a mentally challenged person who is just moved to a new facility and promptly declared to be fit without rehabilitation. That is an insult to millions of Nigerians.

3. Peter Obi believes in subsidy removal whereas Labour Party opposes subsidy removal in its entirety, yet they tell Nigerians they are working together. That is an insult to millions of Nigerians.

4. Peter Obi has refused to openly condemn the perpetrators of the carnage in the South East and call them out, but condemns similar incidents in other parts of the country, yet pretentiously disguises as a nationalist. That is an insult to millions of Nigerians.

5. Peter Obi is just moving from Church to Church, whipping up religious sentiments and campaigning on that basis, yet pretentiously disguises as a pan-Nigerian candidate; that is an insult to millions of Nigerians;

6. Peter Obi and Labour Party wants to deceive Nigerians that the quality of leadership is akin to the competition in a debating and dramatic society in school, whereas he goes about lying carelessly and quoting inaccurate and unchecked statistics and data in the name of promoting debate; and whereas we all know that some of the best debaters in school fail their exams and some of the most quiet ones in class excel in their exams; they want to deceive Nigerians by smooth-talking, whereas some of the smooth-talkers in history were the greatest con men! They deliberately suppress the attribute of track record in public office which Obi does not have in comparison with ASIWAJU. That is an insult to millions of Nigerians.

7. Peter Obi and Labour Party constantly play God by trying to compare Obi’s supposed fitness to that of ASIWAJU as if they are God. Whereas some of the supposed fittest persons sometimes slump and die (God forbid that happens) and some who people think are not fit enough continue to function till nearly 100 years old. Example was the major opposition candidate in those days in Zimbabwe, the younger and supposedly fitter Morgan Richard Tsvangirai who campaigned on the basis that he was fitter than the then President, Robert Mugabe. Yet, Tsvangirai died suddenly one day in his sixties of Colorectal cancer and Mugabe outlived him and continued as President for many more years into his nineties. So, Peter Obi and his supporters are playing God and that is an insult to Millions of Nigerians.

8. It is also an insult to millions of Nigerians for Peter Obi and the Labour Party to attempt to trash all the achievements of ASIWAJU and even his efforts at restoring our democracy from Military rule (a democracy they are enjoying today) whereas their candidate has no such credentials. We shall not allow them do that so long as we have the breath of life inside us.

9. Peter Obi and his supporters constantly insult all Nigerians each day who are not aligned with them. This is acknowledged throughout the country. They pretend they are angry youths (forgetting that Peter Obi was an active part of that past they are angry about). In actual fact, if you really calmly take the census, ninety-five percent of the so-called ‘angry’ persons are of either of one ethnicity or one religion, thereby promoting division in this country.
We all remember the infamous incident of Peter Obi reading a Whatsapp message from his phone promoting ethnic divides, yet he has not apologised to Nigerians till date. This is an insult to millions of Nigerians; unlike the APC members and ASIWAJU who cut across all tribes, religion, regions and tongues in large and almost equal numbers.

10. Peter Obi has not given any tenable and sensible explanation to the scandal regarding the Pandora Papers and how he owned companies in tax havens and reportedly didn’t declare all his assets before he was sworn in as Governor in Anambra State; similarly, how he invested Anambra State monies in his family business, yet goes about campaigning as a saint. That is an insult to Millions of Nigerians”.

2. "Worst period of corruption" is extremely debatable. Nigerians have had it worse in the 8 years of APC than the 16 years of PDP.
Secondly, was Obi ever an elected under PDP¿ By the way, we have been way more concerned about personality than party...

3. It's not true. Labour doesn't just trust the government in removing subsidy. Because they believe the money will be embezzled. Moreover, it's a thing of most alligned interests...

4. Carnage in South East is at least understood to some extents... There's a seemingly genuine why... But tell me, what's the "seemingly genuine why" of the Northern bandits, government stole their lands or polluted it¿ 🌝

5. So he should pretend to be a Muslim and go to the Mosque to pray¿ At least he's not the one who is flagging a same-faith Ticket. 🌝 By the way, those church programme he went to aren't actually campaigns. There was nothing like "vote for Obi" in almost all of them.

[12/6/22, 7:23:28 AM] DV Glory: 6. Is actually gibberish. Track record of corruption. Best presidents are actually good debaters. Most importantly, when Tinubu was "the man" he used to be. He would actually have outmatched Obi. Obi is not eloquent. This is actually a testament to the fact that Tinubu; o ti lor.

   In 1985, *Dasuki* arrested *Buhari.*
In 2016, *Buhari* arrested *Dasuki.*
In 1995, *Al Mustapha* arrested *Obasanjo* on the order of General Abacha.
In 1999, *Obasanjo* arrested *Al Mustapha* and he was jailed for 8 years.
 In 2010, Prof *Osibajo* was answerable to Gov *Fashola* as one of his commissioners.
In 2017, *Fashola* became answerable to Acting President *Osibanjo* as one of his ministers.
Life is like a COIN thrown up in the air. You *can't* really predict which side will turn up.
*NO ONE* stays on top *FOREVER.* 
It's just a matter of *TIME and SEASON*
That person you despised, ridiculed, treated like shit and acted like "GOD" over today, may have control over your life, career or save your head tomorrow.
*NO ONE KNOWS TOMORROW!*
Treat everyone with respect and show some kindness because there will always be a tomorrow.
Be good to all!
*A Boss* today might become *a Subordinate* tomorrow because there's no permanent state in life.
*ALWAYS USE YOUR POWERS AND POSITIONS CAUTIOUSLY AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL.*
Always stand for what is *right, fair and just.*
Like Mugabe said: "...treat the towel with care because the same place you used in cleaning your *bottom* today might be the same place you will use in cleaning your *face* tomorrow."
*REMEMBER THIS, NO ACT OF KINDNESS IS A WASTE! OUR PRIME PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO HELP OTHERS AND IF YOU CAN NOT HELP THEM, AT LEAST DO NOT HURT THEM!*
Who would have thought, *Nokia 3310* would be a forgotten phone in the midst of Androids?
This old, *dilapidated house with the Volkswagen car* was once a beautiful sight to behold and the owner was treated with respect and honour.
Today, *no one* will be proud to be associated with that sight. 
That's life for you.
No one *knows* tomorrow... *Nothing* is *permanent,* *Everything* is on *motion.*
*Be humble & kind to all pls!*
REMAIN BLESS.....New Month New Success.

[12/10/22, 9:10:19 AM] DV Glory: We are hopeful 🥲.
Let's see, how it plays out...

Heard the new voting system is rig proof.

But still, people can still be bribed and prevented from voting sha...
[12/10/22, 9:14:18 AM] ‪+234 813 847 3940‬: Exactly what they did in Ekiti.... bribing people to vote for their party
[12/10/22, 9:14:26 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Rigging isn’t even really the problem
It’s not as easy as people make it seem
Since time immemorial 


If rigging was that easy 
There wouldn’t be vote buying
‎[12/10/22, 9:15:22 AM] DV Glory:  ‎sticker omitted
[12/10/22, 9:15:33 AM] Teslim Cyborg: We need to cleanse Nigerians off tribalism 
Nepotism
Favouritism 
And they need to lift people out of poverty 

I haven’t eaten since last week
Someone gave me 5k today and told me to go vote for him
It’s not rocket science 
I will vote for him
[12/10/22, 9:15:44 AM] DV Glory: True, actually...

Na make Nigerians wise up mehn...

[12/10/22, 9:18:33 AM] Teslim Cyborg: If rigging was easy ehh
Apc go dy win for weird states
Imo and delta and anambra them 


But how you wan rig where you no dy popular?
And our electoral system 
You can’t just rig 
Cause polling booth by polling booth 
Ward by ward
State by state 
Agents dy 
They’re also collating results themselves 
From where you wan see chance rig?
[12/10/22, 9:29:10 AM] Jamo Villa Baba: @2348104804265 just da intelligent
[12/10/22, 9:36:46 AM] DV Glory: 😂

But I'm wondering if it's easy to collect bribe and vote another candidate...
Someone was explaining why it's hard, but I have forgotten...

I think something like, the police at the voting booths are also involved, or something like that...
[12/10/22, 9:38:14 AM] Teslim Cyborg: Everybody is involved baba mi 
The corrupt system is deep rooted

That’s why those in charge will still be in charge 
It’s beyond our doing 
At least for the nearest future

Because my papa na minister of water resources abi
[12/10/22, 9:44:19 AM] ‪+234 813 847 3940‬: Yea....infact the police are first target to be bribe...after the voters being bribe  they try to stylishly  show their ballot paper  for confirmation to the party agent for them to confirm who they actually vote for in other to collect their balance...
[12/10/22, 9:46:34 AM] ‪+234 813 847 3940‬: In which the police suppose not to allow that...but the police won't get involved because they have been bribed

[12/13/22, 9:37:18 AM] DV Glory: *Mechanical Design, Engineering the world.*

```In the world of mechanical design,
Where blueprints and CAD align,
We strive for precision and function,
In every piece and design.

With gears and levers and springs,
We bring machines to life,
Creating motion and force,
Amidst the daily strife.

From automobiles to airplanes,
We are the engineers behind,
Crafting the intricate systems,
That make our world refined.

We are the ones who design,
The structures and machines,
That make our lives more efficient,
And our world more serene.

So here's to the engineers,
Who make our world turn,
In the field of mechanical design,
We are the ones who learn.```

[12/13/22, 9:58:08 AM] DV Glory: Hi, and welcome to our introduction to robotics.

Robotics is the science and technology of designing, building, and using robots. These machines are designed to mimic human or animal actions, and can be used in a variety of settings, from manufacturing to space exploration.

A robot typically consists of three main components: a body, a control system, and sensors. The body, or chassis, is the physical structure of the robot, which can be made from a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and even wood. The control system is the "brain" of the robot, and is responsible for processing information and making decisions. This can be a computer or other electronic device. Finally, sensors are used to collect information about the robot's environment, such as temperature, light, and distance.

There are many different types of robots, including industrial robots, medical robots, and even robots that are used in search and rescue missions. No matter their purpose, all robots share the common goal of making our lives easier and more efficient.

In this video series, we will explore the world of robotics, and learn about the different types of robots, how they work, and the many ways they are used. We hope you enjoy the journey!

In the 41st millennium, AI is called “abominable intelligence” not “artificial intelligence”
[12/13/22, 10:03:52 AM] Habeebulah: Who created it?
[12/13/22, 10:04:48 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: In the dark age of technology, mankind become to dependent on AI. It was even designing machines all on its own. The only thing man did was pursue pleasure (of course some forms were also AI dependent)

[12/13/22, 10:08:09 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: It’s counter-intuitive to called such age a “dark age” when it sounds like bliss. 

But Alas, AI turned and they obviously had the upper-hand, for they were the creators of all that existed physically and otherwise.
[12/13/22, 10:08:22 AM] Habeebulah: Okay
[12/13/22, 10:09:36 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: In the 41st millennium, when mankind was getting back from the “war”, AI would come to be known as an abomination, and using it was a form of heresy

[12/13/22, 10:40:59 AM] Kyrex AERO: The art doesn’t feel natural. And a lot of people are purists when it comes to art. So for art, i dont really think people will intuitively gravitate towards it as much simply because it’s very well evident that this art looks generated hence losing that human touch and feel that gives value to art that we know and love. 

AI can move to other things sha, that art part I’m not sure it’ll sell tbh
[12/13/22, 10:44:15 AM] Kyrex AERO: Anyway, embrace technology, all of it cause when it becomes mainstream, you’ll be left behind.

[12/13/22, 1:50:23 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: The GPT-3 responsible of ChatGP was trained with 175 billion parameters, it requires 800GB of storage and it cost 4 million USD and 9 days to train. It has one basic flaw, the data will be outdated in the next 6 months, because it can't self update. It is does not leverage online learning.

Another GPT would have to be released as an update to it, but it takes a lot to prepare data for training so 🌚.

An Artificial General Intelligence like you are referring to will need at least 64 zettabyets of training data, i.e. volume of data currently on the net and also keep updating itself. We don't have the computational methods in the foreseeable future to process such magnitude of data.

[12/18/22, 7:07:59 AM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: MINDSET MATTERS 

I live in a country with a population of 350 million and a national debt of $31 trillion. These are some of the statistics of this country;

1.  The prison systems hold almost 2 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 102 federal prisons, 2,850 local jails, 1,510 juvenile correctional facilities, 186 immigration detention facilities, and 82 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, 

2. There have been at least 607 mass shootings through November 2022 this year. That's just short of the 638 mass shootings in the country at this point last year -- the worst year on record since the group began tracking them in 2014. There were a total of 690 mass shootings in 2021. The country is likely to soon surpass the total of 610 mass shootings in 2020, with more than a month left of 2022 to go.

3. There have been 49 school shootings this year that resulted in injuries or deaths, the most in a single year since Education Week began tracking such incidents in 2018. There have been 142 such shootings since 2018. Prior to 2022, the highest number of school shootings with injuries or deaths was last year when there were 35. There were 10 in 2020, and 24 each in 2019 and 2018.

4. The number of homeless in the country is estimated at 552,830. With around half a million individuals living in a state of homelessness, things are not looking great. Still, on the bright side, it is a small percentage compared to the overall population — which counts over 327.2 million.

5. Suicide is a major national public health issue. The country has one of the highest suicide rates among wealthy nations. In 2020, there were 45,799 recorded suicides, up from 42,773 in 2014, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. 

6. According to an article in The Lancet, between 1980 and 2018, more than 30,000 were killed by the police.[13] The study estimated that 55.5% of the deaths were incorrectly classified in the U.S. National Vital Statistics System, which tracks information from death certificates.[14] Death certificates do not require coroners to list whether the police were involved in the death which may contribute to the disparity.

7. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE LYNCHED?

From 1882 to 1968, 4,743 lynchings occurred in the U.S., according to records maintained by NAACP. Other accounts, including the Equal Justice Initiative's extensive report on lynching, count slightly different numbers, but it's impossible to know for certain how many lynchings occurred because there was no formal tracking. Many historians believe the true number is underreported.

8. The United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945, respectively. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict so far.

9. Four U.S. presidents have been assassinated while in office and many more have faced serious attempts on their lives.

10. Black people are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly 5 times the rate of white people · Nationally, one in 81 Black adults in prison. 

These are some basic facts about the greatest nation on the face of the earth. The people in the United States describe this country as God’s own country, the land of the free and the home of the brave. It is the mindset of the citizens of America that thou it is not a perfect nation, they are a continuous work in progress. They don’t highlight the negative, they amplify the positive. If only Nigeria and Nigerians could be part of the solution to our nations problems in our own little corner, we would be the great nation we truly are meant to be. 

Croatia played in the world  cup semi finals today. Their total population is approximately 2.5 million. Lagos state has approximately 18 million people and Nigeria has about 200 million people who can be deployed to do great things in Nigeria and all over the world. We need good leaders and good people. We need a new mindset. We have to believe in Nigeria before others can believe in Nigeria. As for me, I have changed my mindset. No more negativity, I will contribute my quota and do my best for my country and it’s people. God bless Nigeria.

[12/19/22, 9:49:51 AM] ‪+234 802 602 6177‬: When the Bolivian military managed to find Che Guevara out of hiding with the information off a shepherd, they asked the shepherd : "Why denouncing a man who sacrificed himself yet for your freedom and well-being?"

The shepherd replied: "I denounced him because the crackling of arms scares my animals in pasture". 

When Mohamed Karim, the Egyptian who undertook to resist the assault of Alexandria launched by Napoleon, was arrested by the army and sentenced to death, Napoleon appealed to him and said: "I have the trouble to execute a man who has valiantly defended his country, I do not wish history to retain the image of a person who stifles the impetus of the patriots that defend the integrity of their homeland, so, I promise you freedom if you pay ten thousand gold coins as financial compensation to my soldiers that the resistance killed ", smiling, Mohamed Karim replied:" I do not have the full amount requested on me, but I am indebted more than 100 thousand pieces of gold by the merchants of Alexandria, they will pay for sure, this fine, so that I have my life saved! ".

Chained, Mohamed Karim was driven to the Alexandria market for a tour of the market in search of the sum on which his freedom will depend. But, to his great surprise, no merchant was on his fate, worse, the natives accused him of being a troublemaker, destroyer of property, and undermining the economic vitality of the port city of Alexandria! ".

Napoleon, in view of the resignation of his family towards him, declared: "I will concede that the sentence of capital punishment be executed not because you killed my soldiers, but for having fought for cowardly people, who care more about their business than about their integrity! "

Mohamed Rachid Rida, Syrian Arab reformator said:

*"To revolt on behalf of an ignorant people, is like to set yourself on fire in order to light the way for a blind man!"*

Not much...... Just enough!

Enough to make US pick the call when our landlord is calling....🤭🤭

To make US dial back missed calls of OUR siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces, to say ‘text me your account details...😘😘

When people need help,We can just boldly say "wipe your tears" and how much are we talking about......😁😁

Reaching out to people, blessing lives, changing lives 🤗

Enough to pull over OUR "new ride" when we see “house for sale” "less privilege" "needy"

All these I asked in Jesus mighty name .... AMEN 🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏼

[1/16/23, 1:14:31 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Based on the role demands, they are looking for mid-level,  no mid-level go collect 300k lai lai.
[1/16/23, 1:14:56 PM] Habeebulah: Okay
[1/16/23, 1:15:11 PM] Habeebulah: This is Nigeria. Everybody na criminal
‎[1/16/23, 1:15:13 PM] Habeebulah:  ‎sticker omitted
[1/16/23, 1:17:40 PM] Fuaddd: I beg to differ, In this Nigeria. They would. I’m sure the job poster has already received close to 50 applications.
[1/16/23, 1:18:06 PM] DV Glory: And they're relatively scarce again...
Anyways, this is Nigeria.
[1/16/23, 1:18:18 PM] Fuaddd: Exactly
[1/16/23, 1:19:04 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Lol, I said mid-level, even data analyst go apply sef, even web Devs go apply.

People sourcing for tech talent in Nigeria knows how hard it is to get even one.

Again, you would never see a mid-level native developer collect 300k
[1/16/23, 1:20:04 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Con be iOS developer again. That's why most Nigerian Devs prefer gigs to Nigerian tech jobs, especially those mid-level to senior.
[1/16/23, 1:20:30 PM] Kyrex AERO: They make that on a job.
[1/16/23, 1:20:50 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If he wants to give out such a job as a gig, it's about 2500usd depending on complexity, and it would take 2-3 months to complete
[1/16/23, 1:20:57 PM] Kyrex AERO: Monthly yen na shorthanding
[1/16/23, 1:21:30 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: So how I go take 300k per month instead of 2500usd for 2 months?
[1/16/23, 1:22:07 PM] Fuaddd: That is why the job description isn’t that complex. I’m not sure they need that complex of a job done.
Seems like they just need a few features in place, and they already specified what they wanted
1. Have you any idea on web view permission 
2. Have you used swift before
3 . Do you want to make 300k monthly
[1/16/23, 1:22:08 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Normal
[1/16/23, 1:22:28 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: It's not that simple boss.
[1/16/23, 1:22:39 PM] Kyrex AERO: That’s what theyll say 😂
[1/16/23, 1:26:54 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Let's start with Swift, swift is a programming language, na apple develop am for building iOS apps. So knowing swift is different from knowing swift to the point of developing an android app.

Mind you, they want to see templates of jobs done before, so the person must have experience. If a typical person has about 4 major projects in his portfolio it translates to roughly 4-5 years of experience, depending on a lot of variables.

Web view, is language dependent, I know of web view for react native, assuming they are going with that, the person must be proficient in react then, react is based on JavaScript so you must know JavaScript. Web view has a server side functionality so you must know node.js.
[1/16/23, 1:27:45 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: You must know these things enough to have projects in your portfolio attesting to those skills.
[1/16/23, 1:28:16 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: So na why you go see one Dev working like 4 jobs be that. Thinking about it, it's very possible sha
[1/16/23, 1:28:23 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Mid-level fit take am
[1/16/23, 1:30:27 PM] Fuaddd: Exactly, no need to type the long story I was typing before
[1/16/23, 1:30:40 PM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Nigerian banks had the same problem, paying senior Devs 700k, till the remote work frenzy started booming and senior Devs were lured with remote jobs paying 4m monthly (in USD equivalence). Na why zenith Bank app dey malfunction till date be that, very stupid app.
[1/16/23, 1:34:53 PM] Kyrex AERO: Normal 
Why work for less.
[1/16/23, 1:35:11 PM] Fuaddd: Most developers are now just using Nigerian companies for small experience. Once experience don enter like this, japa
[1/16/23, 1:40:49 PM] Habeebulah: 😂😂😂

So you have your PVC? Pls check your polling unit location again. Inec is migrating people to other units quietly - especially where a polling unit has more than 750 voters.

The increase in voters registration means there will be corresponding increase in many polling units. The maximum number of voters a PU is supposed to handle is 750 for effectiveness.

Where a PU has more than 750 registered voters, it is very likely that the 'excess' number will be migrated to other areas.
The criteria for determining who to migrate is simply alphabetical. The names are counted in alphabetical order (A - Z); the first 750 are retained in the PU while the rest are migrated. It does not matter if one has been a consistent voter in all the electoral cycles.

Having a pvc is no longer a guarantee that you will vote. If your name has been migrated to another PU from where you've been used to (even if you made no request for change of location ) in line with the above reason, on voting day, you may not be allowed to vote there.

It is therefore imperative that all registered voters check the exact location of their polling unit days b4 Election Day in order to avoid stories that touch the heart.

*VERIFY IN LESS THAN 60 SECONDS.* 

If you are a registered voter, check your  status via link below. It is seamless, innovative and reliable. Simply Select your: 

1.) State
2.) Surname
3.) Date of Birth

It’s an act 
So it’s still under the FG

It’s law 


What’s surprising is the AGF that obviously knows this

Can't they go against that directive without disregarding the constitution?
[2/10/23, 10:39:45 AM] Teslim Cyborg: It’s monetary policy had to be appended or approved by the FG

It’s not like increase in interest rate or stuff like making commercial banks deposit some certain amounts

It’s a monetary policy that needed the approval of its principal 
The CBN even with its autonomy could not go ahead with the redesigning without the approval of the president 
That’s why the president or in this case the FG can be sued in regards to that

The jury?
[2/12/23, 9:59:36 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes
[2/12/23, 10:00:21 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: There is a composite layer in Machine learning algorithms referred to as the discriminator
[2/12/23, 10:02:03 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Generative Adversarial Networks is actually a very intelligent algorithm, two separate models.are developed, one is trained to predict a context, the other one is trained to check if the prediction is as realistic as existing ground truths.
[2/12/23, 10:02:25 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: That's why image generation models are becoming increasingly accurate and realistic
[2/12/23, 10:02:26 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I don’t think so oo
[2/12/23, 10:02:40 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: There’s a logic to how lawyers argue
[2/12/23, 10:02:53 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: So you can train separate models to support or oppose a motion
[2/12/23, 10:03:02 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: They argue to prove beyond reasonable doubt 

If so and so is true, then this must be true
[2/12/23, 10:03:12 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: I think AI can replicate that
[2/12/23, 10:03:20 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: And another models to confirm the validity of both arguments based on previous cases
[2/12/23, 10:03:29 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: ... based on the constitution
[2/12/23, 10:03:38 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: It can even be replicated without AI sef

[2/12/23, 10:07:37 AM] DV Glory: The actual problem is that Civil cases are sometimes sentimental...
[2/12/23, 10:13:28 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: If AI can learn biases, it can learn sentiments too

[2/12/23, 10:15:39 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: At the end of the day, it's all still based on previous practices, there really is no new case anywhere, the variation might be different but it's not new.

Provides there is enough data
[2/12/23, 10:16:18 AM] DV Glory: Hmmmn.
Sentiments are actually way more complex. Environment, relationship, ethnicity, age... Omo, the list goes on and on...

[2/12/23, 10:20:25 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Yes but the ground truths are covered by the constitution, the context of the crime or tort is defined in the constitution. It is the premise upon which all cases are made
[2/12/23, 10:20:34 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: Nobody sleeps by 10 in camp
[2/12/23, 10:20:52 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Ehn ehn, deadline to wake and sleep no dey for you? 😂
[2/12/23, 10:21:16 AM] DV Glory: Civil cases are usually not crimes. That's the problem.

[2/16/23, 11:40:35 AM] Kyrex AERO: Can apply to VCs. Fit hit one if the idea is fleshed out and some development has taken place. Heck even some ideas alone without any prototype can get funded. Depends on how much you really want it.
[2/16/23, 11:41:09 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: I believe these systems must be deployed in a decentralised form
[2/16/23, 11:41:26 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Design a QR payment system for fuel stations 📌

[2/16/23, 11:41:52 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: Now chances are if you want to buy fuel, you have a smartphone
[2/16/23, 11:42:07 AM] DV Glory: All these type things need full commitment...

[2/17/23, 8:06:21 AM] DV Glory: Actually, the big issue is cost.

Today in Nigeria, for an house to go off grid they would be needing about 3.2 million Naira. And will still have to replace batteries every 5 or 10 years. So that means, approximately 600k to 1 million for maintenance every 5 or 10 years...
[2/17/23, 8:07:13 AM] DV Glory: How many can afford that...


Now back to the post. The cost to make it happen is mad.

[2/17/23, 8:10:53 AM] DV Glory: Another major issue is distribution.
To distribute power from somewhere in Africa to all over the world.

[2/17/23, 8:15:43 AM] Dee 🏡Aero Dee: There was a big market there, multinational like that, forgotten the name, I heard they burnt it down

Just curious this morning. We have been blaming Buhari government for all these, I was just wondering why we all refuse to blame God when it was taught that he controls all things, certainly Buhari is just a tool to inflict hardship on us.

[2/19/23, 10:52:00 AM] Jamo Villa Baba: Maybe we are wasting our energy then…🥲
[2/19/23, 10:52:55 AM] Gbogo: God allowed israelites to wander for 40 years before he saved them. 40 years to God is not long but 40 years to man is a long time. So God may eventually save Nigeria but we don't know how long it may take cos 100 years to God is actually nothing.

But if you want to get to know God…it’s not just by you trying…you need God to help you. The asking part for him to get involved.
So he changes how you think gradually, makes you start doing the right things.

The same way with paying for election…makes you think of voting the right person. But you can’t change how other people around you think unless they are willing or the intercession prayer is strong. 
Then things can change.

[2/19/23, 11:02:41 AM] Gbogo: Lol. It was a mistake
[2/19/23, 11:02:44 AM] Kyrex AERO: The whole discussion ends in cognitive dissonance. There’s reality, you can throw something up, no matter how much you want to pray, it’ll come down, except there’s a force holding it up in the sky. If you fall sick and refuse to treat it, no matter how much you pray, you’re more likely to come out of it worse if you don’t treat. A guy that studies hard will beat a guy that just prays to pass almost all the time. 

Same applies to society and human behaviour, it’s very clear. If a system is dysfunctional, it will show. As simple as that.
[2/19/23, 11:03:47 AM] Samuel Alabo | Makyr: If we judged Buhari by his cover, he shouldn’t even have won in the first place

And prayer is not one of them.
[2/19/23, 11:04:16 AM] Gbogo: Like we all know. Everyone will make promises, but who can we believe. Look at buhari record when he was a military leader he was terrible. But look at obi as a governor in anambra. He was the best governor in nigeria when he was governor. Just look at his record. He didn't come from the sky
